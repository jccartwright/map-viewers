<meta name="dc.description" content="1985 Gulf of Mexico Atlas abstract American oyster Crassostrea virginica Osti&#243;n americano Description Range: The American oyster, a bivalve mollusc of the family Ostreidae, is found in the western Atlantic from the Gulf of St. Lawrence to the Yucatan Peninsula. In the Gulf, this species occurs throughout estuaries, shallow nearshore waters, and on reefs located near river mouths. Habitat: Large populations of this benthic invertebrate are found in the large estuarine bays and sounds of the Gulf (with most concentrations found within 10-meter depths). Sedentary in character, this invertebrate attaches in clusters to shell reefs, firm mud/shell bottoms and other hard substrates. Feeding and Behavior: The American oyster filter-feeds principally on small unicellular algae and incidentally on suspended detrital particles. It is found in association with numerous predators, commensals, and parasites. Reproduction: Spawning also occurs in estuarine habitats. In the Gulf of Mexico, April to October are the most active months, although spawning has been reported during all months except February and March. Nursery areas are found in estuarine waters. Movement: Planktonic larvae drift with the tides and currents until they settle on solid substrate. Fisheries: This species is commercially harvested throughout its range for its meat, the seasonality for harvesting being state regulated. The fishery for this species is the fourth largest in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico and there is also a commercial fishery in Mexican waters. The species is harvested recreationally.">

Abstract: oyster reef in the Colorado River delta in the eastern arm of Matagorda Bay, mapped in 2007.  In late February 2007, just after a northern that blew through and made the delta shallow, BIO-West had aerials flown of the delta.  They digitize the aerials.  Then, BIO-West went out in an airboat at high tide in the delta area and coded the oyster formations by percentage density.  Melissa F. told me they coded: 0-25%, scattered shell; 25-75%, no specific label; 75-100%, solid reef.   They incorporated this oyster reef data into the habitat assessment file for the Matagorda Bay Health Evaluation Project (final report 2008). Now one discrepancy- I'm looking at the table for the shapefile, and under density, I see 25, 50, 75.  I'm going to assume 25 means 0-25%, scattered shell; 50 means 25-75%; and 75 means 75-100%, solid reef." Kathleen Welder HRI TAMU-CC  Oyster reef distribution in and around the project area, Eastern Arm of Matagorda Bay (EAMB) and East Matagorda Bay (EMB), was previously mapped by Texas Parks and Wildlife (TPWD) and the TexasGeneral Land Office (GLO) using various sources. The MBHE project team conducted a fieldground-truthing effort in October 2005 to verify and update the distribution maps.Large areas of previously undocumented oyster reefs were identified in the immediate area ofthe new Colorado River delta (CRD) during the 2006 field activities.The extent of Eastern oyster (Crassostrea virginica) reefs in shallow waters in the vicinity of the CRD was revealed during an airboat survey of the area in the fall of 2006 and again in February 2007. The density of these reefs varied from scattered individual oyster clumps to solid oyster reef. On March 5, 2007 the Colorado River Delta (CRD) area was flown and aerial photography was taken directly after a cold front had passed (when strong North winds result in extremely low water levels, exposing much of the delta bay bottom). These aerial photographs were geo-rectified and utilized in GIS form to assess the location and density of oyster reef coverage in the region. Areas possessing oyster reef coverage were digitized with ESRI ArcMap software and categorized into one of three densities:  25% coverage of scattered reef, 25-75% coverage of reef and  75% solid reef areas. Examples of these density categories as seen in the field are provided in Figures 3.1, 3.2 and 3.3 of the 2007 MBHE Report. Mapped oyster reef locations and densities were verified on April 11, 2007 utilizing an airboat and a Trimble Pro XRS GPS unit with sub-meter accuracy. The final mapped extent of oyster reef in the CRD comprised 147.1 acres, which amounts to approximately 20% of the mapped oyster reef in East Matagorda Bay (EMB) and 13% of the mapped oyster reef in the Eastern Arm of Matagorda Bay (EAMB) (Figure 3.4). Of this total, 31.4 acres were classified as  25% coverage by oysters, 60.4acres were classified as 25-75% coverage by oysters, and 55.3 acres were classified as 75%coverage by oysters. The oyster coverage mapped in the CRD in 2007 was added to the final physical habitat map to provide a comprehensive map of existing physical habitat within the project area (Figure 3.5). This final habitat map serves as the physical habitat input to the GIS-based habitat model. This map also has the potential to be updated in the future, as potential changes to physical habitat in the project area occur.  Purpose: To conduct the Matagorda Bay Health Evaluation habitat assessment, statistical models of oyster reef condition, and spatially referenced habitat models were generated using GIS. Fieldwork was conducted to verify previous oyster mapping from TPWD and GLO in EMB and EAMB.  Fieldwork was also conducted to map the unmapped extent of oysters in the Colorado River delta(CRD) region .

The created transects in the above areas and dredged for shell and reef.  They used their field effort and existing TPWD data to create their reef map (which was not meant to be comprehensive of entire Matagorda Bay).  They also coded the reef as 25-50% , and 75-100%." Kathleen Welder HRI TAMU-CC  Oyster reef distribution in and around the project area, Eastern Arm of Matagorda Bay (EAMB) and East Matagorda Bay (EMB), was previously mapped by Texas Parks and Wildlife (TPWD) and the TexasGeneral Land Office (GLO) using various sources. The MBHE project team conducted a fieldground-truthing effort in October 2005 to verify and update the distribution maps.Large areas of previously undocumented oyster reefs were identified in the immediate area ofthe new Colorado River delta (CRD) during the 2006 field activities.The extent of Eastern oyster (Crassostrea virginica) reefs in shallow waters in the vicinity of the CRD was revealed during an airboat survey of the area in the fall of 2006 and again in February 2007. The density of these reefs varied from scattered individual oyster clumps to solid oyster reef. On March 5, 2007 the Colorado River Delta (CRD) area was flown and aerial photography was taken directly after a cold front had passed (when strong North winds result in extremely low water levels, exposing much of the delta bay bottom). These aerial photographs were geo-rectified and utilized in GIS form to assess the location and density of oyster reef coverage in the region. Areas possessing oyster reef coverage were digitized with ESRI ArcMap software and categorized into one of three densities:  25% coverage of scattered reef, 25-75% coverage of reef and  75% solid reef areas. Examples of these density categories as seen in the field are provided in Figures 3.1, 3.2 and 3.3 of the 2007 MBHE Report. Mapped oyster reef locations and densities were verified on April 11, 2007 utilizing an airboat and a Trimble Pro XRS GPS unit with sub-meter accuracy. The final mapped extent of oyster reef in the CRD comprised 147.1 acres, which amounts to approximately 20% of the mapped oyster reef in East Matagorda Bay (EMB) and 13% of the mapped oyster reef in the Eastern Arm of Matagorda Bay (EAMB) (Figure 3.4). Of this total, 31.4 acres were classified as  25% coverage by oysters, 60.4acres were classified as 25-75% coverage by oysters, and 55.3 acres were classified as 75%coverage by oysters. The oyster coverage mapped in the CRD in 2007 was added to the final physical habitat map to provide a comprehensive map of existing physical habitat within the project area (Figure 3.5). This final habitat map serves as the physical habitat input to the GIS-based habitat model. This map also has the potential to be updated in the future, as potential changes to physical habitat in the project area occur.  Purpose: To conduct the Matagorda Bay Health Evaluation habitat assessment, statistical models of oyster reef condition, and spatially referenced habitat models were generated using GIS. Fieldwork was conducted to verify previous oyster mapping from TPWD and GLO in EMB and EAMB.  Fieldwork was also conducted to map the unmapped extent of oysters in the Colorado River delta(CRD) region .  The new CRD oyster mapping was added to the physical habitat input file for the MBHE habitat model.During fieldwork conducted in spring 2007, data was collected on commercial size oysters and dermo infestation of reefs in the CRD and East Matagorda Bay (EMB), as was information on the use of shallow estuarine habitats by juvenile shellfish and finfish across the Matagorda Bay system.

It is important to understand what factors control oyster distribution to effectively maintain and manage the present oyster reefs and associated habitats. Understanding controls on distribution can also aid in oyster reef protection and restoration efforts.The American or Eastern Oyster (Crassostrea virginica) is the prevalent oyster species along the northern Gulf of Mexico coast, including Copano Bay, Texas. C. virginica has a free-swimming larval stage, lasting 14 to 30 days, after which the larva goes through a settling, or spatting process in which it must permanently attach itself to the bottom (Kennedy, 1996). During the larval stage, the oyster is susceptible to the multitude of estuarine hydrodynamic processes that distribute the larva throughout the estuary. C. virginica is a filter feeder, so it needs to settle and attach to a site which will permanently keep it out of the fine bay bottom mud to avoid suffocation by fine-grained sediment. It also needs to settle within the intertidal to subtidal portion of the bay, to allow it access to tidal flow and nutrients (Kennedy, 1996). Over the course of history in Texas bay systems, the oysters have been able to accumulate and form reefs in areas that are favorable to their success. Copano Bay is an "upper bay" system within the Mission-Aransas-Copano Bay system (Figure 1). Copano Bay has undergone very little modification, it has no dredged navigational channels and in general lacks significant infrastructural modifications found in other bays, such as Galveston, Corpus Christi or Lavaca Bays. As a result, it is an ideal setting to investigate the natural controls on oyster reef distribution. The oyster reefs in Copano Bay appear to consist of longitudinal reefs attached to the shoreline extending perpendicularly into the bay, longitudinal reefs in the middle of the bay oriented parallel to shoreline and patch reefs that are randomly oriented throughout the bay. Surficial sediments contained within Copano Bay consist primarily of unconsolidated muds, sands, and shell gravel. With the lack of obvious controls on the distribution of oyster reefs, such as rock outcrops, the big question is, what does control their distribution? It is our contention that the natural distribution of oyster reefs in Copano Bay are controlled mainly by the antecedent geology found beneath the bay sediment. Oysters will form in areas where there exists shallow, hard substrate ideal for oyster attachment. Studying the underlying geology of oyster reefs could have major implications on understanding their distribution. This study will have significant implications for the future research and resource management in Copano Bay, such as oyster reef protection and restoration. Restored reefs can be placed in areas where known stable underlying geology is present to ensure the reef is successful and the oysters not subside into the soft bay mud and become suffocated by fined grained sediment particles. If large extents of buried oyster reefs are found, this could indicate an enormous decline in oyster reef population over time and actions could be taken to prevent any further decline from happening.Copano Bay has undergone very little modification, it has no dredged navigational channels and in general lacks significant infrastructural modifications found in other bays, such as Galveston, Corpus Christi or Lavaca Bays.

If large extents of buried oyster reefs are found, this could indicate an enormous decline in oyster reef population over time and actions could be taken to prevent any further decline from happening.  Purpose: For the purpose of this study, the substrate type will be considered the most important influencefor the initial distribution of oyster reefs. Regardless of other environmental conditions, the substratemust be suitable for initial oyster colonization or the oyster will not survive. Where there are oyster reefspresent in the geologic past, there was adequate substrate for initial settlement. Adequate substrateincludes any hard, smooth surface such as compacted mud, sand or shell shoals, lose shell or sunken logs.Loose sand or mud can shift and break the oyster free of its anchor, or bury and suffocate it (Kennedy,1996). The ideal substrate for larval oysters has been found to be existing reef or oyster shells (Kilgen andDugas 1989; Stanley and Sellers 1986; Michener and Kenny 1991; Kennedy, 1996). Some current oysterreefs are most likely built on top of reefs that initially grew thousands of years ago when the incisedpaleo-river valleys began to fill with sediment (Bouma, 1976). The oyster reefs build up vertically andout horizontally with new oysters growing atop older ones. Ideally, without significant outside physicalinfluences to move them, the present day oyster reefs would exist in the same general locations as wherethey were initially colonized, only to a larger extent. However, oyster reefs do not only build atop otherreefs. If suitable substrate is formed or becomes available elsewhere, larvae will also settle atop itforming a new reef. Therefore each reef in the current oyster reef distribution may have differentgeologic controls.  Supplemental Information: This is the final report of our CMP Cycle 12 project to identify and delineate oyster reefsand other bottom features in Copano Bay. This project was conducted during twosuccessive CMP Cycles, Cycles 11 &amp; 12. During the Cycle 11 we conducted the bulk ofthe field component of the geophysical mapping. During Cycle 12 will processed thegeophysical data and generate maps and prepare the final report and conducted followupfield work, including field verification of the areas identified as reef.

Logical Consistency Report: To test the validity of our oyster reef map we conducted a survey to verify the accuracy of ourinterpretations. To do this a geo-referenced grid was placed over the mapped area in GIS with a grid area of 4 kilometers squared, or a grid length/width of 2,000 meters. Then points were randomly selected in each grid using GIS for each mapped category, for a total of 155 survey sites. We used a stratified design selecting 50 sites in the Oyster Reef category, 31 on Mud, 20 on Sand, and 10 each on Shell on Mud and Shell on Sand.At each each station physico-chemical data (depth, water temperature, dissolved oxygen, percentsaturation, pH, salinity), secchi depth, wind speed and direction, and sea state data were collected. For theoyster dredge collections we employed the data collection procedures employed by the TPWD CoastalFisheries Division for their oyster population surveys (TPWD, 2002). This includes, in addition to countsof live oysters and dead shell, a count of live spat on five live oysters and five dead shells, plus the lengthsof up to 19 live oysters are measured.An initial analysis of the data (UNIVARIATE; SAS, 1990) determined that the count data for liveoysters and dead shell was not normally distributed as there was an abundance of zero values. Ananalysis of variance (ANOVA) was performed on the ranked count data for both live oysters and deadshell. Then a Tukey type multiple comparison was performed on the map classification categories forboth the live oyster and dead shell (Zar, 1999). These analyses were performed on both the originalvalidation data and the supplemented validation data with the adjusted map classification categories.  Completeness Report: Over 200 survey lines each with a spacing interval of 150 m provided nearly completecoverage of the baybottom. Survey cover was limited to areas with a minimum of 1.2 m water depth toprotect the equipment from damage.

To do this a geo-referenced grid was placed over the mapped area in GIS with a grid area of 4 kilometers squared, or a grid length/width of 2,000 meters. Then points were randomly selected in each grid using GIS for each mapped category, for a total of 155 survey sites. We used a stratified design selecting 50 sites in the Oyster Reef category, 31 on Mud, 20 on Sand, and 10 each on Shell on Mud and Shell on Sand.At each each station physico-chemical data (depth, water temperature, dissolved oxygen, percentsaturation, pH, salinity), secchi depth, wind speed and direction, and sea state data were collected. For theoyster dredge collections we employed the data collection procedures employed by the TPWD CoastalFisheries Division for their oyster population surveys (TPWD, 2002). This includes, in addition to countsof live oysters and dead shell, a count of live spat on five live oysters and five dead shells, plus the lengthsof up to 19 live oysters are measured.An initial analysis of the data (UNIVARIATE; SAS, 1990) determined that the count data for liveoysters and dead shell was not normally distributed as there was an abundance of zero values. Ananalysis of variance (ANOVA) was performed on the ranked count data for both live oysters and deadshell. Then a Tukey type multiple comparison was performed on the map classification categories forboth the live oyster and dead shell (Zar, 1999). These analyses were performed on both the originalvalidation data and the supplemented validation data with the adjusted map classification categories.Completeness Report: Over 200 survey lines each with a spacing interval of 150 m provided nearly completecoverage of the baybottom. Survey cover was limited to areas with a minimum of 1.2 m water depth toprotect the equipment from damage.Attribute Accuracy Report: Validation of oyster reef mapsTo test the validity of our oyster reef map we conducted a survey to verify the accuracy of ourinterpretations.

<dt><i>Other_Citation_Details</i>:</dt><dd bgcolor="#EFEFEF">Abstract: In 2006 and 2007 the NOAA Coastal Services Center purchased services to process existing digital multi-spectral imagery (ADS-40) and create digital benthic habitat data from this imagery for selected Texas coastal bend bays. The Center worked cooperatively with the Texas Parks and Wildlife Department (TPWD) and the Texas A&amp;M University Center for Coastal Studies to develop benthic habitat data, primarily Submerged Aquatic Vegetation (SAV) for several coastal bays.  This data will support the state's recently adopted Seagrass Monitoring Program which calls for regional mapping of SAV for status and trends assessment.  The Center, Texas A&amp;M, and TPWD have coordinated on the requirements of this project.  Purpose: These data have been created as a result of the need for having geospatial data immediately available and easily accessible in order to enhance the capability of the NOAA Coastal Services Center (CSC).  Supplemental Information: Benthic habitat vector data for lower Laguna Madre was divided into three study areas.  The geographic extent of these areas is ~800mi2.  Benthic habitat data was generated from 2004 NAIP imagery for all estuarine lands below mean high water within the study area. No benthic data was required for the marine side of the barrier beaches.  Data Set Credit: NOAA Coastal Services Center  Logical Consistency Report: For the reprocessed imagery, compliance with the accuracy standard was ensured by the placement of photo identifiable ground control points. A total of 18 photo identifiable ground survey points was used for the calculations.  An RMS value was calculated based on the imagery reprocessed for this project by comparing the aerotriangulated X and Y coordinates. This value represents an estimate of the accuracy of the horizontal coordinate measurements in the tile expressed in meters. For the final map product Initial Map accuracy assessment was used as a tool to prioritize areas for further field examination and after field investigation to prioritize those areas where additional modeling or interpretation was needed. Error matrices showing both deterministic and fuzzy accuracies were compiled for the initial map. Based on the results compiled from the assessment, the team visits any classes exhibiting inaccuracy and addressed the classes through modeling, additional analysis or manual editing.  Completeness Report: Compliance with the accuracy standard for the reprocessed imagery was ensured by the placement of photo identifiable ground control points and the collection of airborne GPS data.  Compliance with the accuracy standard for the final map product was ensured by field checks and manual editing.  Accuracy Report: Horizontal accuracy of the reprocessed source imagery was verified to be better than 5 meters at 90% confidence level in accordance with National Map Accuracy Standards for a 1-meter GSD. The accuracy of the contractor's final map is 89% and the accuracy of the final map is 90%. Overall final map deterministic accuracy is 88% (with fuzzy accuracy at 90%) which exceeds the contract standard of 85%.  Additionally, 14 of the 16 final map class producer's and consumer's accuracies are at 85% which exceeds the contract standard of 80%.  However, the deterministic producer's accuracy for emergent marsh is 77%, and the user's accuracy for unconsolidated sediments is 72%.  Horizontal Accuracy Report: Accuracy assessment determined by evaluating the horizontal accuracy obtained during the aerotriangulation process for each lift for the reprocessed imagery and by field verification for the completed map product.  Source Information: REPORT OF GPS SURVEY TEXAS COASTAL AREA MAPPING, Terrasurv Inc., 20051017-20051109, model, Source Scale Denominator: 1000, Media: paper, Abbreviation: GPS Ground Control; Source Contribution: TerraSurv, Inc. of Pittsburgh, PA was contracted by EarthData International of Frederick, MD to perform a geodetic control survey in support of mapping an area along the southeasterly coast of Texas between Port Lavaca and Brownsville. Thirty-eight photo identifiable locations were surveyed to provide ground control and quality assurance checks for the mapping. Twenty of the stations were used for mapping control and eighteen of the stations were used for quality checks. The horizontal datum was the North American Datum of 1983, CORS adjustment (NAD 1983 CORS). The vertical datum was the North American Vertical Datum of 1988 (NAVD 1988).  Source Information: 2004 ADS40 Digital NAIP Imagery, Northwest Geomatics, 20041103-20041111, remote-sensing image, Source Scale Denominator: 900, Media: digital tape media, Abbreviation: Imagery; Source Contribution: The digital orthophotography was developed from imagery acquired as part of the 2004 over flight of the State of Texas developed for the USDA National Agricultural Imagery Program (NAIP). In order to achieve a horizontal accuracy of 5 meters, CE90 it is necessary to reprocess the imagery incorporating new GPS field control. It should be noted that the imagery was not tide coordinated so tidal variation may exist between sorties.  The imagery was acquired between November 3, 2004 and November 7, 2004.  Process Step: The original 1m DOQQs for the project area were resampled to 2m and mosaicked.  For habitat classification, the mosaicked imagery was divided into two processing areas; one set of two mosaics for true color and one set of two mosaics for color-IR.  Image segmentation was performed using on the blue, green, red, and near-infrared bands for each of the six processing areas.   The classification of the habitat segments (as ESRI polygon shapefiles) was performed using CART analysis.  The habitat maps for each of the two areas was refined with the aid of field data collected during July, August, and October 2007. The two processing area shapefiles were edge matched and combined into a single shapefile which was clipped to the final project area boundary and then clipped into three separate shapefiles; north, middle, and south regions.  Adjacent regions do not overlap.  Each polygon, within and across all three delivery regions, has a unique polygon identification number.  Each shapefile was checked for proper topology and to insure that each polygon has a correct habitat label, habitat code, modifier label if resent, unique identification number, and an area calculation. Polygons below the 100m2 minimum mapping unit (MMU) were eliminated, though some polygons &lt;100m2 were retained if their area changed to below the MMU due to the polygon boundary smoothing process.  The habitat data also went through an independent validation review.  Accuracy assessment was performed on seven classes with Patchy SRV and Continuous SRV being combined into a single accuracy class.   For field data collection, non-random sites in the form of polygons were chosen by analysts with an attempt to sample all available image signatures.  These sites were visited in the field and data on each site was collected directly into digital format (ESRI shapefile) using a laptop or onto a paper form that was later entered into digital format. Sites were navigated to primarily using a Garmin GPS 76 unit connected to a Panasonic Toughbook laptop displaying the project imagery and polygons in ArcMap v9.1 or using the GPS unit alone.  Habitat classification was estimated as accurately as possible using methods or combination of methods which included above water observation, snorkeling, wading, and underwater video.  This data was entered into an ESRI shapefile via a digital field form in ArcMap specifically developed for this type of field data collection.  More sample polygon sites were collected in-office based on the in-field collected sites in order to meet the 30 sites per class accuracy assessment requirement.  For each class, a random selector macro in ArcMap was used to randomly select 30 sites for accuracy assessment.  The entire pool of accuracy sites was kept separate from the remaining sites and only used for accuracy assessment during the project.  Anonymity of the accuracy sites was maintained throughout the project because it was unnecessary to ever visually review these sites in order to perform the accuracy analysis.  More accuracy assessment sites were collected in a later field collection to add to the analysis.  These sites were chosen by randomly selecting polygons within specific regions that were pre-determined to be visited. Information for these sites was collected using the same methods for the other sites.  Accuracy information was compiled using ArcMap. The zonal stats tool in ArcMap was used to determine the majority map class each accuracy polygon intersected with.  An accuracy assessment error matrix was generated using this information by importing it to Microsoft Excel and building the matrix.  Both deterministic and fuzzy accuracy assessment were performed.  The accuracy analysis and error matrices are presented and discussed in the Lower Laguna Madre Final Accuracy Assessment Report. Process Date: 20770809 Imagery Fugro EarthData, Inc.

Oyster reefs not only support the oyster fishery but also serve as habitat, forage ground, or hiding places for numerous estuarine species.  Purpose: The oysters data set is a compilation of three data sets.  The firs data set was developed by Dr. Eric Powell of Texas A&amp;M University's Department of Oceanography under the auspices of the Galveston Bay National Estuary Program.  The reefs were mapped using acoustic equipment designed to return echo signal from the bay bottom.  In very shallow areas where a smaller boat was used, it was not possible to hang the equipment over the side of the boat; therefore a poling technique was used to determine the location of the oyster reefs.  The second and third data sets were both acquired from the Texas Parks and Wildlife Department.  One was developed by a team led by Warren Pulich and used aerials circa 1989.  The other was developed by Betsi Blair which also used aerial photographs and surveyed submerged aquatic vegetation including oyster reefs.  Access: Free to public.

For the most part, these hard, highly acoustically reflective surfaces are oyster reefs, but in addition oyster covered pilings, oyster covered pipelines and hard surface sand deposits displayed a high reflectance signature.  In addition to the sidescan sonar, subbottom profiler data was consulted in areas that indicated there was a hard bottom structure, as its depiction of the sea bottom surfaces and subbottom structure can be of valuable assistance in discerning oyster reefs from sand or other hard bottom structures, such as Rangia clam beds (Simons, 1992).  As we developed signatures and potential oyster reefs, signatuare verification cruises were conducted to verify the signatures and build confidence in our ability to correctly interpret the acoustic signal and our mapping technique.A total of 3,249 acres of oyster reefs were mapped in Lavaca Bay during the study.  The major reefs mapped during the study were Chicken Reef, Lap Reef, Gallinipper Reef, Middle Ground Reef, Sand Point Reef, Rhodes Point Reef, Keller?s Bed and Keller Reef.  In addition, there were many small, usually linear, patch reefs that have grown up, particularly on the submerged spoil banks along side the dredged ship channels in Lavaca Bay.  A comparison of oyster reefs mapped in the present study to the historic maps, indicate that there has been a decrease of 3,088 acres (52%) of oyster reef since the mapping effort of Moore and Danglade in 1913.  On the other hand, the areal extent of oyster reefs has increased by approximately 892 acres since the 1961 survey conducted by Munro (1961), an increase of 46%. Purpose:habitat, has a broader focus than just mapping.  As a result, there are additional sections in this report on the basement structure of Lavaca Bay the history of hurricane impacts on Lavaca Bay, including the impact of Hurricane Claudette.The objectives of this study are:1.Map the oyster reefs in Lavaca Bay, Texas using sidescan sonar and sub-bottom profiler surveys,2.Document the change in morphology and extent of oyster reefs in Lavaca Bay by comparing historical maps with the current survey,          A project to map the bathymetry, oyster reefs, sediment facies, subbottom stratum and anthropogenic impacts in Lavaca Bay, Texas was conducted by Texas Parks and Wildlife Department, Texas A&amp;M University, Galveston and Texas A&amp;M University, College Station.  The oysters and oyster reefs, which represent an historic and important fishery and shell resource of Lavaca Bay, had not been systematically mapped since 1961 (Munro, 1961).  This project used acoustic devices to collect high resolution geophysical data, ie. bathymetry, surface bottom type and subbottom data.  Field collection of geophysical data began in the fall of 2002 and was completed in the late summer of 2003.  Field ground truth surveys were begun in the spring of 2003 and completed in December of 2004.  Data compilation, analysis and synthesis began in the spring of 2003, while compilation of the oyster reef maps began in the fall of 2003 and was completed in the fall of 2004. Supplemental Information: Oysters are an important economic and ecological resource of Lavaca Bay and other Texas bays and estuaries.  Ecologically, the oyster reefs are a unique habitat for many organisms, and they play an important role in filtering the bay waters of suspended matter, including bacteria, silt, and phytoplankton.  Many of the oyster reefs in these bays have not been mapped recently, and their extent is poorly known.  In addition, some of the oyster resources have been depleted due to over-harvesting, decreased freshwater inflow and disease.A search for historical data revealed an old map of the oyster reefs of Lavaca Bay as they existed in 1913 (Moore and Danglade 1915).  Their project was a very intensive and comprehensive survey of the oyster reefs of the major portions of Lavaca Bay, with only Keller Bay not being mapped.  Their survey included 16,153 depth soundings and 800 waypoints over the course of 362 miles of survey lines. There were 464 collections of bottom types and oyster counts, 228 over reefs and 236 over barren bottoms, thus providing not only the extent of the oyster reefs but also an indication of the abundance of oysters on the reefs.  A total of 6,226 acres of dense oyster reefs were mapped, with 5,970 of those acres occurring in the same area as this study.  In 1961 another survey of the oyster reefs of Lavaca Bay was conducted (Munro 1961).  This survey does not appear to be as intensive as the 1913 survey of Moore and Danglade, for although it does map out the extent of the oyster reefs and compares them to the 1913 map, there is not information on the abundance of oysters on the reefs.  The maps of Munro do indicate that the oyster reefs of Lavaca Bay had become quite depleted in the intervening 48 years since the Moore and Danglade survey.  Munro reports that there is less than a third of the acreage of oysters in 1961 as there were in 1913.  Thus, using one-third as the upper limit, there were at most an estimated 2,075 acres of oysters in Lavaca Bay in 1961.  The estimated acreage of oysters in the study area for this project is 1,990 acres.</dd>

Oyster reefs not only support the oyster fishery but also serve as habitat, forage ground, or hiding places for numerous estuarine species.  Purpose: For mapping at a scale of 1:24000 or smaller.  Access: Free to public.</dd>
