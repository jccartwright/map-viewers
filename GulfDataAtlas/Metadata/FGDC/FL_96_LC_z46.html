While the accuracy of a 1996-era classification is hard to
determine based on 2000-era ground truth, the 1996-era
classification is composed of approximately 86% of the
final 2000-era classification. This is because only the
areas of change between 1996 and 2000 were classified for
the  classification. Then the classified
layer was overlaid onto the
classification. Therefore the accuracy assessment for the
classification is still a good estimate of the
accuracy of the  classification. According
to accuracy assessment performed by Sanborn, the overall
accuracy is 85.2% and 85.1% Kappa. The accuracy results
shown below are from US Gulf Coast zone 46. A total of 1485
points are located in US Gulf Coast zone 46.
Each class accuracy is as follows: (Errors of Omission/Commission)
0 Background (N/A)
1 Unclassified (Cloud, Shadow, etc)(N/A)
2 High Intensity Developed (71%/98%)
3 Medium Intensity Developed (18%/29)
4 Low Intensity Developed (74%/48%)
5 Open Spaces Developed (47%/43%)
6 Cultivated Land (87%/88%)
7 Pasture/Hay (87%/75%)
8 Grassland (84%/68%)
9 Deciduous Forest (74%/88%)
10 Evergreen Forest (95%/84%)
11 Mixed Forest (69%/77%)
12 Scrub/Shrub (78%/91%)
13 Palustrine Forested Wetland (89%/82%)
14 Palustrine Scrub/Shrub Wetland (63%/66%)
15 Palustrine Emergent Wetland (70%/66%)
16 Estuarine Forested Wetland (N/A)
17 Estuarine Scrub/Shrub Wetland (0%/82%)
18 Estuarine Emergent Wetland (95%/87%)
19 Unconsolidated Shore (92%/94%)
20 Bare Land (74%/91%)
21 Water (99%/99%)
22 Palustrine Aquatic Bed (N/A)
23 Estuarine Aquatic Bed (N/A)
24 Tundra (N/A)
25 Snow/Ice (N/A)
The validation points were both collected in the field and
photo interpreted. The accuracy assessment selection
methods were developed to minimize spatial autocorrelation
between the training and accuracy assessment. The first
pool of accuracy assessment sites came from field data and
photo interpretation of black and white digital orthophotos
and digital color infrared imagery (primarily Ikonos data).
These sites were collected prior to initial mapping and
were collected at the same time as the training data. The
sites were selected to capture the physical and spectral
diversity of the land cover. After the first criteria was
met, the accuracy assessment sites were buffered to see if
they fell within 1000 meters of another accuracy assessment
site of the same class or within 1000 meters of a training
site of the same class. Those that fell within the 1000
meter buffer were eliminated. All sites were to be from a
homogeneous 3x3 area. After an analysis of the point
distribution, it became clear that there were not enough
samples for every class. The remaining points were selected
from the initial draft final classification and had to be a
homogeneous 3x3 area. Sampling was limited to areas where
there was high resolution color infrared imagery. The
imagery included the previous Ikonos imagery, but also
included an additional 20 scenes of Ikonos imagery. The
additional Ikonos imagery provided sampling areas across
the entire study area. Classes which had a proportionally
larger representative land area had larger numbers of
samples . When possible, we tried to identify 50 samples of
each of the classes. Exceptions were for the following
classes (actual sample numbers): Grassland/Herbaceous (49)-
Palustrine Emergent Wetland (36)- Estuarine Scrub/Shrub
Wetland (3)- Unconsolidated Shore (36)- Palustrine Aquatic
Bed (1)- Estuarine Aquatic Bed (1) A total of 1485 accuracy
assessment points were used excluding urban classes. 1708
accuracy assessment points were used including urban points.
All classes have a minimum of 50 accuracy assessment points
except for the classes mentioned above. These classes are
limited in the study area and to some extent in the imagery
that was available to sample from.

This dataset was created by Sanborn Mapping Company. This version of the
classification is the  (1996-era). The study area is the Coastal
zone 46 Region. A  (2000-era)classification is also available for
the same area.
Pre-processing steps:
Each Landsat TM scene was geo-referenced by USGS (United States Geological
Survey) EROS Data Center. The Sanborn staff reviewed the spectral and
spatial quality of the imagery. Areas that were greater than 1-2 pixels off
were sent back to USGS for reprocessing. The data was geo-referenced to
Albers Conical Equal Area, with a spheroid of GRS 1980, and Datum of NAD83.
The data units is in meters. The zone 46 TM data was delivered in the
form of USGS zone mosaics. The data included three dates of TM: leaf-on,
leaf-off, and spring. For each date of TM, spectral and tasseled cap data
were received.
Change Detection:
Once the  and  images were aligned, the next step was to
determine the areas of change between the 1996 and 2000-era data. Since the
2000-era classification was already complete, it is only necessary to classify
the areas of change to create a 1996-era classification of the same
specifications. Change detection was performed on each of the eight image
pieces. A difference image was created using the six spectral bands of the
leaf-on  imagery and the six spectral bands of the  imagery
(spring). This difference image was clustered into 150 classes. Classes of
change were recoded into one change class. In addition, change detections using
the same method, were performed between the  leaf-on image and the
spring image, and the  leaf-on image and the  leaf-
off image. These areas of change were added to the change mask to account for
differences between the  images. Once the change was combined into one
file, small patches of change (4 and less pixels) were eliminated to remove
noise. Then a 3x3 focal majority filter was applied to fill in some patches.
The change layer over-estimated change to ensure that all changed areas were
captured in the mask.
Classification:
The classification of the , 1996-era data was a mixture of
automated and manual approaches. The change mask was used to identify areas
in the  classification that had not changed since 1996. These
were considered areas that could be used to collect training points. A
stratified random sample of points were selected from the non-change areas
of the  classification. Over 5000 training points were selected
from the non-change areas. Points were reviewed to ensure that they were
labeled correctly. The training points were supplemented with additional
points in the areas that did change and for classes that did not have
enough samples. An  classification was created using this training
data set in the CART discrete decision-tree software. The model was applied to
a mosaic of the  image pieces.
The change mask was used to mask the  classification. This area of
change from the  was compared to the same area of the
classification. Illogical changes were reviewed and modeled out or to other
classes when appropriate. The  area of change was then reviewed
against both the 1996 and 2000 era TM data to identify omitted and committed
change as well as change that had gotten the wrong class call. When the manual
edits were complete, the final  classification was generated by using
the 1996  classification in areas that had changed and the 2000
classification in areas that had not changed.
After the field points for training were collected, they were combined with
photo-interpreted points and used as the dependent variable in a CART
classification approach. Many layers tested as independent layers.  They
included three dates of spectral and tasseled cap imagery, DEM, slope, aspect,
texture, band indices (NDVI, Moisture, NDVI-Green), shape indices fractal
dimension, compactness, convexity, and form), Census data (housing and
population density). Statistical analyses and visual inspection of the output
was used to eliminate data that was redundant or not useful in the
classification. Additional training points were added to help reduce some of
the confusion between classes. The rough classification was created at the end
of this process using only the CART discrete decision-tree software. A
provisional classification was produced by applying spatial models using
ancillary data to the rough classification. The final automated map was then
edited using hand editing techniques while using high resolution imagery from
as reference data. Independently, of this process, NOAA produced percent
impervious data layers for Zone 46. This layer was developed from Regression
Tree and used impervious classifications from IKONOS imagery to predict pixel
level percent impervious at the TM pixel level. The continuous percent
impervious data was thresholded to produce the to developed categories and
imbedded into the final map.

interpreted points, zone 46 GAP reclassified by NOAA (Gap Analysis Program),
Census data (housing and population density), Ecoregions.
QA/QC Process:
There were several QA/QC steps involved in the creation of this product. First,
there was an internal QA/QC. This was done by viewing the classification frame-
by-frame along with the TM imagery, the classification, and high resolution
reference imagery. NOAA staff completed a similar review and provided both
general and point comments.
