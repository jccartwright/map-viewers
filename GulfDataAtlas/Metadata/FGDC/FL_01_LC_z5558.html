The validation points were both collected in the field and photo interpreted.  The sites were selected to capture the physical and spectral diversity of the land cover.  Because the starting point for this classification was the NLCD data produced by the Southeast GAP, this data layer was utilized in identifying potential AA sites.  Segments created with Definiens software were buffered in one pixel to eliminate edge effect.  Segments smaller than the assessment's minimum mapping unit of 3x3 pixels were eliminated.  The remaining segments were summarized by the NLCD data and segments with a majority class equaling less than 90% were removed.  The remaining segments were entered into the pool of potential AA sites.  The field sampling then focused on labeling these segments with the goal being to collect a minimum number of 50 samples per class with samples stratified geographically to ensure that the diversity of the landscape and imagery was captured. Sites collected in the field were then verified in the office using the triple date imagery to ensure consistency with all dates, and classes with less than 50 samples were supplemented with photo interpreted sites.  For some classes, the minimum of 50 sites could not be achieved and as many sites as possible were used.  These classes and their actual sample numbers are:  Deciduous Forest (33); Mixed Forest (25); Estuarine Forested Wetland (0); Estuarine Scrub/Shrub Wetland (2); Palustrine Aquatic Bed (6); Estuarine Aquatic Bed (0). These classes are either rare or scattered in the area making it difficult to locate homogeneous sites for these classes.
Accuracy assessment sites were QC'd to ensure that edge effects, heterogeneity, and sample size would not adversely affect the assessment. In addition as some of the class definitions were refined through the draft review processes, the AA database was updated to reflect these changes.  A total of 1,292 accuracy assessment points were used excluding urban classes.

This section outlines the classification procedure for zones 55/58 C-CAP Late Date (2000 ERA) classification.  Three image mosaics were used for this classification each from a different phenological season: leaf-on,leaf-off and spring, with each mosaic comprised of varying scene dates within the season.  The three dates of imagery were first reviewed for image quality and shifts between image dates.  Unlike many other zones, zone 55 and 58 began with an initial GAP classification.  This provided a starting point for the classification, with initial data review focusing on differences in land cover class definitions. Local and regional differences were dentified and these issues were then systematically processed using standard image analysis techniques, both automated and manual, to refine and improve the dataset. There were 2 major versions of this map prior to the final product: the provisional map and the contractor final.  The provisional map was the direct result of automated modeling efforts, such as agricultural homogeneity models, on the initial Southeast GAP dataset.  This provisional product was then reviewed by NOAA to provide initial feedback on the classification.  The second product, the contractor final, was the result of incorporating the comments from the provisional product and continued modeling and editing of the dataset to improve the quality and consistency of the land cover classfication.  This version also incorporated a NOAA refinement to the impervious dataset.  The contractor final dataset was reviewed by NOAA and their few remaining comments incorporated into the final product.  At this time, the product was also edgematched to neighboring zones producing the final product described here.
Pre-processing steps:
Each Landsat TM scene was geo-referenced by USGS (United States Geological Survey) EROS Data Center. The Sanborn staff reviewed the spectral and spatial quality of the imagery. Areas that were greater than 1-2 pixels off were sent back to USGS for reprocessing. The data was geo-referenced to Albers Conical Equal Area, with a spheroid of GRS 1980, and Datum of NAD83. The data units is in meters. The data included three dates of TM- leaf-on, leaf-off, and spring. For each date of TM, spectral and tasseled cap data were received.
<br/>
Field-Collected Data:
The goals of the field data collection were to sample the diversity of the landscape, within the classes, and among image dates.  Because this product began with the classification from Southeast GAP, the field data collection was targeted more at visiting as many varying sites as possible throughout the study area to identify trends where the initial classification varied from the NOAA scheme.  To meet these goals, Sanborn used laptop computers and GPS (Global Positioning System) to accurately locate field points on the TM imagery. Software downloaded from the Minnesota's Department of Natural Resources (DNR) was used to connect the Garmin GPS to the laptop computer and ESRI's ArcView software. An ArcMap application developed by Sanborn allowed rapid and accurate entry of field point locations and accompanying notes. These data were stored in a shapefile which could be easily displayed over the classification during reviews as well as being used in data assessment routines.  Both general assessment and validation points were collected together. See the accuracy assessment section to see how the points were split into general assessment and validation points.
Items that were collected were:
Land Cover characterization
Special conditions and remarks
Photograph Number if applicable
Date/time location
The data and equipment used for the fieldwork are as follows:
Ancillary datasets:
NLCD - mosaicked into zones
State road map and Delorme state atlas www.delorme.com

Extra batteries (lap-top and GPS)
Mobile phones

pre-determined routes Wetland and Vegetation Field Guides
Image data for each zone
Initial classifications
Classification:
After the field points were collected, they were combined with photo-interpreted points and used to assess correlations and discrepancies between the initial GAP classes and the NOAA classification scheme.  Where adjustments needed to be made spectral layers and their derivatives such as tasseled cap and NDVI images, along with ancillary datasets such as DEM, slope, aspect, texture, NWI, and SRTM were used in local and regional models to refine the classificaition.  These models resulted in the provisional dataset for this classification, which was deliverd to NOAA for review.  Additional refinements in modeling along with manual editing were used to improve the dataset and to address comments from NOAA's review of the provisional dataset.  Independently of this process, impervious data layers for zones 55/58 were created. This layer was developed from Regression Tree and used impervious classifications from IKONOS imagery to predict pixel level percent impervious at the TM pixel level. The continuous percent impervious data was thresholded to produce the developed categories and imbedded into this product to produce the contractor final product, which was again reviewed by NOAA.  Incorporation of these final comments from NOAA along with edgematching to neighboring zones produced the final z55/z58 C-CAP classification.

<br/>
QA/QC Process:
There were several QA/QC steps involved in the creation of this product. An internal QA/QC was completed prior to each delivery. This was done by viewing the classification frame-by-frame along with the TM imagery, the classification, and high
resolution reference imagery. NOAA staff completed similar reviews for each delivery and provided both general and point specific comments.
