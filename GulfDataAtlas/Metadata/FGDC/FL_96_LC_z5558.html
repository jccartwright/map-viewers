This data set contains the 1996-era classification of
the SE Atlantic, zone 55 and zone 58, and can be used to analyze change
between the 1996 and 2000 classifications. This imagery was collected as
part of the Multi-Resolution Land Characteristics program in a multi-
agency effort to provide baseline multi-scale  environmental
characteristics and to monitor environmental change.  This data set
utilized full or partial Landsat 5 Thematic Mapper scenes which were
analyzed according to the Coastal Change Analysis Program (C-CAP) protocol
to determine land cover.

While the accuracy of a 1996-era classification is hard to determine based on 2000-era ground truth, the 1996-era classification is composed of approximately 89.3% of the final 2000-era classification. This is because only the areas of change between 1996 and 2000 were classified for the  classification. Then the classified  layer was overlaid onto the  classification. Therefore the accuracy assessment for the  classification is still a good estimate of the accuracy of the  classification. According to accuracy assessment performed by Sanborn, the overall accuracy is 81.2% and 0.793 Kappa. The accuracy results shown below are from US Coastal zones 55/58.  A total of 1508 points are located in US Coastal zones 55/58.
Each class accuracy is as follows:
(Errors of Omission/Commission)
0 Background (N/A)
1 Unclassified (Cloud, Shadow, etc)(N/A)
2 High Intensity Developed (79.2%/79.2%)
3 Medium Intensity Developed (52.8%/37.3%)
4 Low Intensity Developed (45.8%/57.9%)
5 Open Spaces Developed (78.3%/85.5%)
6 Cultivated Land (86.4%/93.7%)
7 Pasture/Hay (80.6%/74.6%)
8 Grassland (71.1%/60.4%)
9 Deciduous Forest (48.8%/63.6%)
10 Evergreen Forest (92.7%/96.6%)
11 Mixed Forest (40.7%/44%)
12 Scrub/Shrub (60.3%/67.7%)
13 Palustrine Forested Wetland (88.3%/82.5%)
14 Palustrine Scrub/Shrub Wetland (71%/72.1%)
15 Palustrine Emergent Wetland (77.6%/75%)
16 Estuarine Forested Wetland (N/A)
17 Estuarine Scrub/Shrub Wetland (100%/100%)
18 Estuarine Emergent Wetland (100%/95.3%)
19 Unconsolidated Shore (100%/84.8%)
20 Bare Land (93.8%/77.9%)
21 Water (90.1%/100%)
22 Palustrine Aquatic Bed (100%/50%)
23 Estuarine Aquatic Bed (N/A)
24 Tundra (N/A)
25 Snow/Ice (N/A)

The validation points were both collected in the field and photo interpreted.  The sites were selected to capture the physical and spectral diversity of the land cover.  Because the starting point for this classification was the NLCD data produced by the Southeast GAP, this data layer was utilized in identifying potential AA sites.  Segments created with Definiens software were buffered in one pixel to eliminate edge effect.  Segments smaller than the assessment's minimum mapping unit of 3x3 pixels were eliminated.  The remaining segments were summarized by the NLCD data and segments with a majority class equaling less than 90% were removed.  The remaining segments were entered into the pool of potential AA sites.  The field sampling then focused on labeling these segments with the goal being to collect a minimum number of 50 samples per class with samples stratified geographically to ensure that the diversity of the landscape and imagery was captured. Sites collected in the field were then verified in the office using the triple date imagery to ensure consistency with all dates, and classes with less than 50 samples were supplemented with photo interpreted sites.  For some classes, the minimum of 50 sites could not be achieved and as many sites as possible were used.  These classes and their actual sample numbers are:  Deciduous Forest (33); Mixed Forest (25); Estuarine Forested Wetland (0); Estuarine Scrub/Shrub Wetland (2); Palustrine Aquatic Bed (6); Estuarine Aquatic Bed (0). These classes are either rare or scattered in the area making it difficult to locate homogeneous sites for these classes.
Accuracy assessment sites were QC'd to ensure that edge effects, heterogeneity, and sample size would not adversely affect the assessment. In addition as some of the class definitions were refined through the draft review processes, the AA database was updated to reflect these changes.  A total of 1,279 accuracy assessment points were used excluding urban classes.

This section outlines the classification procedure for zones 55/58 C-CAP Early Date (1996 ERA) classification.  Each Landsat TM scene was geo-referenced by USGS (United States Geological Survey) EROS Data Center. The Sanborn staff reviewed the spectral and spatial quality of the imagery with special attention paid to the early dates alignment with the late date. Areas that were greater than 1-2 pixels off were sent back to USGS for reprocessing. The data was geo-referenced to Albers Conical Equal Area, with a spheroid of GRS 1980, and Datum of NAD83.
Change Analysis:
Once the  and  images were aligned, the next step was to determine the areas of change between the 1996 and 2000-era data. Since the 2000-era classification was already complete, it was only necessary to classify the areas of change to create a 1996-era classification of the same specifications. Change detection was performed on each of images. A difference image was created using the six spectral bands of the leaf-on  imagery and the six spectral bands of the  imagery (leaf on). This difference image was clustered into 150 classes. Classes of change were recoded into one change class. In addition, change detections using the same method, were performed between the  leaf-on image and the  spring image, and the  leaf-on image and the  leaf-off image. These areas of change were added to the change mask to account for differences between the  images.  The change layer over-estimated change to ensure that all changed areas were captured in the mask.
Classification:
The classification of the , 1996-era data was a mixture of automated and manual approaches. The change mask was used to identify areas in the  classification that had not changed since 1996. These were considered areas that could be used to collect training points. A stratified random sample of points were selected from the non-change areas of the  classification. Over 5000 training points were selected from the non-change areas. Points were reviewed to ensure that they were labeled correctly. The training points were supplemented with additional points in the areas that did change and for classes that did not have enough samples. An  classification was created using this training data set in the CART discrete decision-tree software. The model was applied to a mosaic of the  image pieces. The change mask was used to mask the  classification. This area of change from the  was compared to the same area of the  classification. Illogical changes were reviewed and modeled out or to other classes when appropriate. The  area of change was then reviewed against both the 1996 and 2000 era TM data to identify omitted and committed change as well as change that had gotten the wrong class call. When the manual edits were complete, the final  classification was generated by using the 1996  classification in areas that had changed and the 2000  classification in areas that had not changed.

QA/QC Process:
There were several QA/QC steps involved in the creation of this product. An internal QA/QC was completed prior to each delivery. This was done by viewing the classification frame-by-frame along with the TM imagery, the classification, and high
resolution reference imagery. NOAA staff completed similar reviews for each delivery and provided both general and point specific comments.
