According to accuracy assessment performed by Sanborn, the
overall accuracy is 84.1% and 83.5% Kappa. The accuracy
results shown below are from US Gulf Coast zone 36 and zone
37. A total of 1696 points are located in US Gulf Coast
zone 36 and zone 37.
<br/>
Each class accuracy is as follows: (Errors of Omission/Commission)
0 Background (N/A)
1 Unclassified (Cloud, Shadow, etc)(N/A)
2 High Intensity Developed (48%/93%)
3 Medium Intensity Developed (69%/67%)
4 Low Intensity Developed (80%/48%)
5 Open Spaces Developed (36%/50%)
6 Cultivated Land (88%/85%)
7 Pasture/Hay (81%/86%)
8 Grassland (77%/75%)
9 Deciduous Forest (67%/69%)
10 Evergreen Forest (85%/89%)
11 Mixed Forest (70%/80%)
12 Scrub/Shrub (91%/86%)
13 Palustrine Forested Wetland (90%/84%)
14 Palustrine Scrub/Shrub Wetland (58%/66%)
15 Palustrine Emergent Wetland (76%/81%)
16 Estuarine Forested Wetland (N/A)
17 Estuarine Scrub/Shrub Wetland (0%/0%)
18 Estuarine Emergent Wetland (94%/85%)
19 Unconsolidated Shore (80%/85%)
20 Bare Land (66%/72%)
21 Water (94%/96%)
22 Palustrine Aquatic Bed (0%/0%)
23 Estuarine Aquatic Bed (0%/0%)
24 Tundra (N/A)
25 Snow/Ice (N/A)
The validation points were both collected in the field and
photo interpreted. The accuracy assessment selection
methods were developed to minimize spatial autocorrelation
between the training and accuracy assessment. The first
pool of accuracy assessment sites came from field data and
photo interpretation of black and white digital orthophotos
and digital color infrared imagery (primarily Ikonos data).
These sites were collected prior to initial mapping and
were collected at the same time as the training data. The
sites were selected to capture the physical and spectral
diversity of the land cover. After the first criteria was
met, the accuracy assessment sites were buffered to see if
they fell within 1000 meters of another accuracy assessment
site of the same class or within 1000 meters of a training
site of the same class. Those that fell within the 1000
meter buffer were eliminated. All sites were to be from a
homogeneous 3x3 area.
After an analysis of the point distribution, it became
clear that there were not enough samples for every class.
The remaining points were selected from the initial draft
final classification and had to be a homogeneous 3x3 area.
Sampling was limited to areas where there was high
resolution color infrared imagery. The imagery included the
previous Ikonos imagery, but also included an additional 20
scenes of Ikonos imagery. The additional Ikonos imagery
provided sampling areas across the entire study area.
Classes which had a proportionally larger representative
land area had larger numbers of samples . When possible, we
tried to identify 50 samples of each of the classes.
Exceptions were for the following classes (actual sample
numbers): Deciduous Forest (43)- Bare Land (31)- Estuarine
Scrub/Shrub Wetland (3)- Palustrine Aquatic Bed (10)-
Estuarine Aquatic Bed (0). A total of 1696 accuracy
assessment points were used excluding urban classes. 1833
accuracy assessment points were used including urban
points. All classes have a minimum of 50 accuracy
assessment points except for the classes mentioned above.
These classes are limited in the study area and to some
extent in the imagery that was available to sample from.

This dataset was created by Sanborn Mapping Company. This
version of the classification is the  (2001-era).
The study area is the Coastal zones 36 and 37 Region. An
(1995-era) classification is also available for the same
area.
Summary:
This section outlines the classification procedure for
the zones 36 and 37 C-CAP Late Date map. The three dates of imagery
were first reviewed for image quality and shifts between
image dates. Training points were used as the dependent
variable in a CART (Classification Analysis by Regression
Tree)approach. Derivative data layers (NDVI, Tasseled Cap)
were calculated from the TM data and were used as
additional independent variables in the analysis. There
were 3 major versions of the map prior to a draft map: 1)
the provisional map, 2) automated (incl. draft and final)
and 3) final edited. The provisional map was developed
prior to field work to give an idea of potential areas to
sample. This rough map represented the first output from
the CART classification routine. Ancillary data (DEMs, etc)
and spectral data were used in this and all other CART
models. The final automated map had additional points from
the field and photo interpretation added. Points were
continually added until the best possible model was
developed. This represented a fully automated product. This
product was then altered by hand edits to refine the
classification. In addition, a percent impervious data
layer developed from TM data using high resolution imagery,
was imbedded into the classification to define the
developed classes. This produced the final-with-edits
version which is the final version of the classification
and is the one described here.
Pre-processing steps:
Each Landsat TM scene was geo-referenced by USGS (United
States Geological Survey) EROS Data Center. The Sanborn
staff reviewed the spectral and spatial quality of the
imagery. Areas that were greater than 1-2 pixels off were
sent back to USGS for reprocessing. The data was
geo-referenced to Albers Conical Equal Area, with a
spheroid of GRS 1980, and Datum of NAD83. The data units is
in meters. The zones 36 and 37 TM data was delivered in the form of
USGS zone mosaics. The data included three dates of TM-
leaf-on, leaf-off, and spring. For each date of TM,
spectral and tasseled cap data were received.
Field-Collected Data:
The goals of the field data collection were to sample the
diversity of the landscape, within the classes, and among
image dates. Classes that would be more difficult to
collect from air photos were targeted for field data
collection. To meet these goals, Sanborn stratified the
image into spectral clusters and located the field sites
throughout the study area based on these. In addition to
these pre-arranged sites, Sanborn collected points while
driving between locations. Due to limited time and
accessibility, not all polygons were assessed in the field.
Those that we did not visit on the ground were labeled with
digital orthophotographs or Ikonos data if it was
available. Both training and validation points were
collected together. See the accuracy assessment section to
see how the points were split into training and validation
points. Sanborn used laptop computers and GPS (Global
Positioning System) to correctly locate field points on
the TM imagery. Software downloaded from the Minnesota's
Department of Natural Resources (DNR) was used to connect
the Garmin GPS to the laptop computer and ESRI's ArcView
software.
Sanborn's programmer developed an ArcMap application that
allowed entry of location and field notes with a click of
the mouse. These data were stored in a shapefile.
Items that were collected were:
Land Cover characterization
Special conditions and remarks
Photograph Number
Date/time location
The data and equipment used for the fieldwork are as
follows:
Ancillary datasets:
TIGER 2000
NLCD - mosaicked into zones
State road map and Delorme state atlas www.delorme.com
Hardware: with ArcView/ArcGIS and data
GARMIN GPS modules and external antennae, redundant data
cables
Cameras devices (Floppy Drives, CD Burners, external HDD)

Image data for each zone
Initial classifications
Classification:
After the field points for training were collected, they
were combined with photo-interpreted points and used as
the dependent variable in a CART classification approach.
Many layers tested as independent layers. They included
three dates of spectral and tasseled cap imagery, DEM,
slope, aspect, texture, band indices (NDVI, Moisture,
NDVI-Green), shape indices fractal dimension, compactness,
convexity, and form), Census data (housing and population
density). Statistical analyses and visual inspection of the
output was used to eliminate data that was redundant or not
useful in the classification. Additional training points
were added to help reduce some of the confusion between
classes. The rough classification was created at the end of
this process using only the CART discrete decision-tree
software. A provisional classification was produced by
applying spatial models using ancillary data to the rough
classification. The final automated map was then edited
using hand editing techniques while using high resolution
imagery from as reference data. Independently, of this
process, NOAA produced percent impervious data layers for
zones 36 and 37. This layer was developed from Regression Tree and
used impervious classifications from IKONOS imagery to
predict pixel level percent impervious at the TM pixel
level. The continuous percent impervious data was
thresholded to produce the developed categories and
imbedded into the final map.

Ancillary Datasets:
Non-TM image datasets used are DEM (Digital Elevation
Model), slope, aspect, positional index, NWI, NLCD,
TIGER2000, field-collected points, photo-interpreted
points, zones 36 and 37 GAP reclassified by NOAA (Gap Analysis
Program),Census data (housing and population density),
Ecoregions.
QA/QC Process:
There were several QA/QC steps involved in the creation of
this product. First, there was an internal QA/QC. This was
done by viewing the classification frame-by-frame along
with the TM imagery, the classification, and high
resolution reference imagery. NOAA staff completed a
similar review and provided both general and point comments.
