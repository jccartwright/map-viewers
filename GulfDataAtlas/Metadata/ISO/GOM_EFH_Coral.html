<b>      abstract: </b>
<b></b>          Essential fish habitat (EFH) for Gulf of Mexico Corals consists of the following waters and substrate areas in 
          the Gulf of Mexico: the total distribution of coral species and life stages throughout the Gulf of Mexico 
          including: coral reefs in the North and South Tortugas Ecological Reserves, East and West Flower Garden 
          Banks, McGrail Bank, and the southern portion of Pulley Ridge; hard bottom areas scattered along the 
          pinnacles and banks from Texas to Mississippi, at the shelf edge and at the Florida Middle Grounds, the 
          southwest tip of the Florida reef tract, and predominant patchy hard bottom offshore of Florida from 
          approximately Crystal River south to the Florida Keys. Essential fish habitat (EFH) consists of known 
          distributions of species in the fishery management unit (GMFMC 2004). Location of coral, dated 2014, is 
          based on the 2005 identification and description of EFH for Coral and Coral Reefs.
<b>      purpose: </b>
<b></b>          The purpose of these data is to visually represent the textual description of the overall extent of EFH for 
          the Coral Fishery Management Plan which contains all species of the class Hydrozoa and the class Anthozoa.

              for the Coral Fishery Management Plan which contains all species of the class Anthozoa and the class 
              Hydrozoa. Seven species of coral of the class Hydrozoa and 311 species of the class Anthozoa are 
              referred to specifically in the fishery management plan as occuring in the Gulf of Mexico and/or South 
              Atlantic waters.

<b></b>                  The Functional Relationship Analysis in GMFMC 2004 was utilized to select habitat polygons that fit 
                  within the criteria identified that each species and lifestage utilizes in growth to maturity. Each 
                  habitat polygon was selected or not selected based upon each variable. EFH maps were derived 
                  selecting higher density polygons from the Functional Relationship Analysis from species and 
                  lifestages in which no density information was available from the NOAA Atlas (i.e. if species and 
                  lifestage density was represented by a map in the NOAA Atlas, that species and lifestage was not 
                  incorporated into the mapping). The following data were used to create these data: Seagrass from 
                  Florida Fish and Wildlife Research Institute (FWRI) and Texas Natural Resources Information System 
                  (TNRIS), Marshes from FWRI and US Geological Survey, Mangroves from FWRI, Oysters from FWRI and 
                  TNRIS, Coral from FWRI, Coral from the NOAA Data Atlas, and Summarized Sediments. Bathymetry from 
                  FWRI. Bathymetry depth contours were acquired from the Florida Marine Resource Institute (FMRI). 
                  Each EFH boundary was clipped south of the EEZ along the Texas/Mexico boarder and south of the Gulf 
                  of Mexico/South Atlantic Fisheries Management Council boundary along the Florida Keys. The 
                  intercoucnil boundary (along the Florida Keys) was generated from legal descriptions downloaded from 
                  the Federal Register. An adjustment was made for Grand Lake and White Lake in southwest Louisiana, 
                  which were initially mis-identified as estuarine and later re-classified as non-estuarine, based on 
                  U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service National Wetlands Inventory data. Thus, those lake were not 
                  considered for identification as EFH for red drum, reef fish, coastal migratory pelagics, shrimp and 
                  stone crab fishery management units. Several layers with the selected polygons were mapped as a 
                  composite represention of EFH for each fishery management unit. The maps depicting these density and 
                  habitat utilization data were deliberated by the GMFMC in developing the textual (regulatory) 
                  descriptions of essential fish habitat for Gulf of Mexico Fishery Management Plans.

<b></b>                  The layers representing the composite EFH were merged into a single shapefile for each fishery 
                  management unit. The new shapefile was reprojected to NAD 1983 Albers and edited to match the 
                  textual identification and description of EFH using ArcGIS' editing environment. Any inland water 
                  bodies mistakenly included in the previously delivered layers were extracted also using the "Edit 
                  Clip" function in ArcGIS' editing environment. In order to fill the gaps within the EFH that were 
                  caused by previous digitizing errors, a large overlapping polygon was created inside of the existing 
                  EFH boundaries. This polygon was digitized manually to cover from just inside of the seaward 
                  boundary to the northern extent of the EFH. After filling in the gaps, any "dangling" polygons 
                  extending beyond the seaward boundary were identifed and removed. To obtain a single feature 
                  representing the entire EFH for each fishery management unit, the updated EFH was clipped to a 
                  master polygon representing the extent of the entire Gulf of Mexico. Once this clip was completed, 
                  the result was a "dissolved" polygon consisting of one feature rather than 10-40 thousand individual 
                  polygons. The new EFH polygon was then clipped to the land boundary feature using the ArcGIS' 
                  editing environment. This resulted in an EFH polygon that is exactly coinicident with the land 
                  boundary. During the creation of these data, the land boundary (coast line) feature used was 
                  "camra_mrgis_gulf_shore_100.shp" (1:100,000) from FWC/FMRI (Florida Fish Wildlife Conservation 
                  Commission, Florida Marine Research Institute) . Finally, the area in square kilometers and the 
                  perimeter in meters was calculated in ArcGIS and listed in the EFH attribute table for each fishery 
                  management unit.

<b></b>                  Location of coral, dated 2014, is based on the 2005 identification and description of EFH for Coral 
                  and Coral Reefs. The Unified Florida Reef Tract data from FWC/FMRI (http://myfwc.com/research/) was 
                  merged with the 2005 coral EFH layer, and clipped to the Gulf of Mexico and South Atlantic council 
                  boundary. The Texas bank data was delineated from sidescan sonar by H. Nash and Gulf of Mexico 
                  Fishery Managment Council staff, and replaced the coral areas in the 2005 coral EFH layer.
<b>              rationale: </b>
<b></b>                  The coral data from these two sources was deemed to more accurately represent actual coral locations.
