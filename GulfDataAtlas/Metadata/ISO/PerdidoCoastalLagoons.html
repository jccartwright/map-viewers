<b>      Abstract: </b>
<b></b>          Over the past eight years we have been surveying three coastal lagoons in the Perdido Bay area. This work has 
          been funded by several agencies, including NSF, the Mississippi-Alabama Sea Grant Consortium and the Alabama 
          Center for Estuarine Studies. Three students have graduated from that work (one MS and two Ph.D.'s) and a 
          good number of papers are in press or submitted. The variables measured comprise physical and chemical 
          variables (water-column salinity, temperature, oxygen, light penetration, water-column dissolved inorganic 
          nitrogen, dissolved organic nitrogen, particulate organic nitrogen, phosphate, and sediment pore water 
          inorganic nutrients) and biological variables (microalgal chlorophyll concentrations in the water-column and 
          sediment, seagrass structure, biomass and productivity, seagrass nutrient content, epiphyte biomass, 
          diversity and abundance of invertebrate fauna in seagrass patches and bare sediment, and system 
          metabolism-gross primary productivity, respiration, and net community productivity for water-column, 
          seagrass patches and bare sediment). Furthermore, the three lagoons cover a wide gradient of human pressure, 
          from a pristine lagoon to a lagoon with a moderately developed watershed to a lagoon with a highly developed 
          watershed, thereby allowing us to make inferences as to how human utilization of watersheds affects the 
          health of coastal lagoons and services offered to humankind and wildlife. Thus, this research is proving 
          instrumental for the creation of policies of environmentally-sustainable development and use of coastal 
          watersheds by humans. We are continuing our survey and carrying out manipulative experiments to improve our 
          understanding of these systems and our ability to create effective environmental policies.
<b>      Purpose: </b>
<b></b>          This project is an ongoing survey of the physical, chemical and biological variables of three distinct 
          lagoonal environments in Perdido Bay, Florida.

<b>              Description: </b>
<b></b>                  To quantify daytime benthic metabolism, we measured change in dissolved oxygen concentration within 
                  clear and dark acrylic benthic chambers incubated under ambient light conditions. The chambers were 
                  bell-shaped, with a diameter of 17.5 cm and a height of 16.0 cm, encompassing 0.032 m2 of bottom 
                  area. They were inserted into the sediment up to a pre-marked insertion point on the chamber (2.5 cm 
                  from the bottom edge) to enclose a final water volume of 3.0 l, giving the chambers a very small 
                  perimeter-to-volume ratio. Chamber volume was set in the lab prior to deployment and was viewed as a 
                  compromise between insertion depth and adequate volume to reduce chamber-wall effects. After a field 
                  trial, a set of 10 chambers was randomly sampled to assure that volume enclosed within each chamber 
                  averaged 3.0 l and did not vary with reuse. On each sampling day, we haphazardly placed 10 pairs of 
                  chambers within mixed shoalgrass/widgeongrass atches and 10 pairs on bare sediment in State Park and 
                  Kees Bayou, with each pair containing one clear and one dark chamber. Ten pairs of chambers were 
                  placed on each sampling date on the bare sediment of Gongora. To capture the gradient in sediment 
                  nature found in the lagoon (see above), the pairs were placed haphazardly at locations regularly 
                  distributed from the mouth to the upstream end. We recorded the times at which we started and 
                  finished deploying the benthic chambers, which normally took approximately 1 h. These noted times, 
                  along with the total number of chamber pairs deployed, allowed us to estimate the start time of 
                  incubation for each pair of chambers. In addition, we filled 5 clear and 5 dark 300 mlBOD bottles 
                  with water from the study site while the chambers were being deployed. Water from the mid 
                  water-column (i.e. between 20 and 40 cm deep) near the first pair of chambers was collected and 
                  carefully siphoned into the bottles from the bottom to avoid any bubble formation. Immediately after 
                  filling the bottles, we measured water oxygen concentration for each bottle using a high-sensitivity 
                  field oxygen meter and recorded the time of reading. The bottles were subsequently anchored to the 
                  bottom near the first pair of chambers for incubation. The average value of these initial oxygen 
                  concentrations in the bottles was taken as the initial concentration for the chambers (see Eqs. 1 &amp; 
                  2). Chambers and bottles were incubated for approximately 4 h encompassing solar noon on sunny days 
                  in order to maximize system dynamics. At the end of the incubation period, a 60 ml sample of water 
                  was pulled out of the chamber using a syringe and attached tubing inserted through a 1 cm diameter 
                  access port. The water sample was taken at approximately middistance into the chamber headwater. The 
                  water was then transferred to a 60 ml BOD bottle and the oxygen concentration read with the oxygen 
                  meter and the time of reading recorded. We did not stir the water within the chambers during 
                  incubation. Previous work (Huettel &amp; Gust 1992) has shown that stirring during incubations on porous 
                  sediments, such as the sediment found in our study sites, may generate substantial porewater flows, 
                  profoundly biasing O2 concentrations in the overlying water and thus influencing metabolism 
                  measurements. However, in the absence of stirring, the dissolved O2 produced or consumed due to 
                  benthic microalgal or seagrass metabolic processes may not uniformly mix throughout the chamber due 
                  to diffusion gradients. In turn, such gradients could also bias measurements. This, however, should 
                  not be a significant concern, since our 60 ml water samples were taken at approximately mid-chamber 
                  in an attempt to homogenize the chamber and break gradients that could have formed during 
                  incubation. To confirm this, we took aliquots (i.e. several measurements taken within the same 
                  chamber) regularly and haphazardly throughout the 2 yr that this project lasted. Aliquots were 
                  always very similar (i.e. within 10 to 15% of each other), thereby demonstrating that any possible 
                  stratification within the chambers was of no significant consequence for our metabolism 
                  measurements, particularly in view of the large range covered by the values obtained (see also 
                  Stutes et al. 2006). A further concern that could lead to depressed estimates of oxygen production 
                  or consumption in the chambers is that lack of stirring could allow gradients in dissolved compounds 
                  to develop around leaf surfaces and the sediment surface thus slowing exchange with the water column 
                  and possibly limiting metabolic processes (Touchette &amp; Burkholder 2000). This caveat should be 
                  considered when comparing our measurements with other results in the literature, but it should be of 
                  no consequence for our conclusions because they are based on the relative differences in oxygen 
                  production or consumption between seagrass patches and bare sediment. The extent of underestimation 
                  of oxygen production/consumption committed with our technique should apply similarly to both types 
                  of substratum. We also measured the oxygen concentration in the 300 ml BOD bottles at the end of the 
                  incubation period, recorded the time of the reading, and subtracted the mean change in oxygen 
                  concentration within the bottles for clear or dark bottles from the total change (i.e. integrating 
                  the bottom and enclosed headwater) measured in each clear or dark chamber in order to examine 
                  benthic processes only (see Eqs. 1 &amp; 2). For each clear chamber, we calculated benthic community net 
                  production (NP, in mgC m2 h1), and for each dark chamber, benthic community respiration (R, in mg 
                  C m2 h1), as: NP = VC [(FC  I) /t  PC]/A (1) R = VC [(FD  I) /t  PD]/A (2) where V is the 
                  volume of water enclosed in the chamber (in l), C is the conversion factor from oxygen to carbon, FC 
                  and FD are the final oxygen concentrations (mgO2 l1) in the clear and dark chambers, I is the mean 
                  initial oxygen concentration in the chamber obtained from the bottles (mgO2 l1, see above), t is 
                  the incubation period (h), PC and PD are the mean changes in oxygen concentration recorded for clear 
                  and dark bottles (mgO2 l1 h1; see above), and A is the area of the incubation chamber (m2). These 
                  values were converted into carbon using an appropriate photosynthetic quotient and respiratory 
                  quotient. Finally, benthic community gross primary production (GPP; mgC m2 h1) was calculated as 
                  the difference between NP and R, which, since R is always a negative value, corresponds to GPP = NP 
                  + |R|. This approach assumes that respiration rates in the dark equal respiration rates in the 
                  light, which may not be the case. For instance, for microalgae light respiration rates are often 
                  higher than dark respiration rates due to a variety of mechanisms, including photoacclimation 
                  (Grobbelaar et al. 1992, Herzig &amp; Dubinsky 1992). If that was of significant consequence in our 
                  study, our values could underestimate GPP in seagrass patches and bare sediment, since benthic 
                  microalgae are prominent in both bottom types. Nevertheless, the differences in GPP between the 2 
                  bottom types, on which our conclusions are based, should be robust, particularly in view of the 
                  large magnitude of those differences. System-integrated benthic metabolism. To examine the impact of 
                  differences in areal metabolic rates (i.e. rates per m2 of seagrass patch or bare sediment) across 
                  lagoons and relative cover by each of the 2 bottom types (seagrass patches and bare sediment) on 
                  system-integrated benthic daytime metabolism, we derived weighted rates of benthic GPP, R and NP for 
                  each lagoon as: Weighted rate = (SR × SC) + (BSR × BSC) (3) where SR and BSR are the mean areal 
                  metabolic rates for seagrass patches and bare sediment (i.e. rates per m2 of seagrass patch or bare 
                  sediment), respectively, for the entire study duration (i.e. average of all single measurements), 
                  and SC and BSC are the mean fractions of total bottom covered by sseagrass or bare sediment, 
                  respectively, (and error terms), for all the estimates based on aerial photography. Flights used to 
                  determine this were restricted to a maximum of 300 m due to logistics. In order to reduce artifacts 
                  due to oblique viewing, the altitude and direction of the flights were kept consistent. The 
                  photographs were scanned using a 12-bit scanner and color corrected using Adobe Photoshop 7.0. 
                  Percent cover was then estimated using Sigma Scan Pro 4.0. Values of percent cover could not be 
                  derived on some dates dues to reduced water column clarity. In Gongora, weighted rates simply 
                  equaled the mean areal rates for bare sediment because there was never any seagrass present. To gain 
                  further insight into differences in metabolic rates between bottom types (seagrass patches vs. bare 
                  sediment) within and across lagoons, we also measured the biomass of the 2 main types of benthic 
                  primary producers in our study sites, i.e. seagrass (plus epiphytes) and benthic microalgae. 
                  Seagrass biomass was sampled using a 15.5 cm inner-diameter PVC core that was inserted into the 
                  sediments to a depth of 12 cm to ensure collection of all below-ground biomass. On each sampling 
                  date, we took 5 cores within patches haphazardly chosen in the lagoon (only in State Park and Kees 
                  Bayou) and 5 cores in bare sediment (10 in Gongora). Samples were bagged and stored on ice for 
                  transport to the lab where they were frozen at 10°C until processed. Once thawed, the samples were 
                  rinsed through a 500 µm sieve and all seagrass material was sorted out. Seagrass biomass was 
                  separated into above- and below-ground compartments, dried at 60°C until constant weight was 
                  achieved and then combusted at 500°C to determine the ash free dry weight (AFDW) per unit area (g 
                  AFDW per m2 of bottom). We also separated bentic invertebrates (bigger than 500 µm) and quantified 
                  them in broad categories (amphipods/isopods/tannaids, bivalves, gastropods, shrimp, crabs and 
                  annelids). We used chlorophyll a (chl a) concentration as an indicator of benthic microalgal biomass 
                  (Daehnick et al. 1992). To accomplish this, we sampled the sediment using a 2.5 cm diameter corer 
                  and sliced the top 1 cm sediment layer into a centrifuge tube, which was stored on ice and 
                  transported to the lab. In the lab, the samples were frozen at 80°C until processed. Upon thawing, 
                  chlorophyll was extracted for a 24 h period with 25.0 ml of acetone (Strickland &amp; Parsons 1972). Chl 
                  a concentrations were measured fluorometrically with a Turner Designs Model TD-700 fluorometer using 
                  acidification (1N HCl) to correct for the presence of phaeopigments. Chlorophyll values were 
                  standardized to sediment area (mg chl a m2 of sediment). On each sampling day, one core was taken 
                  adjacent to each pair of benthic chambers incubated on bare sediment, for a total of 10 cores per 
                  lagoon per sampling day. Sampling started in October 2001 and is still ongoing, with a frequency of 
                  4-6 sample periods per year. Less than 10 d separated sampling events for all 3 lagoons within a 
                  sampling period. Incubation and biomass measurements were taken on the same day every time a lagoon 
                  was sampled. In order to examine site differences in water quality, water column physical parameters 
                  were also recorded during this period on the same dates as the measurements of producer biomass and 
                  rates of metabolism. These parameters include bulk water column dissolved oxygen (mg l1), salinity 
                  (ppt), and temperature (°C) measured using a YSI 85 multiprobe; water-column transparency (defined 
                  as percentage of incident light to the amount of light reaching the benthos) using a pair of Li-Cor 
                  193sa sensors and data logger; and depth (m) using a standard meter stick. Measurements were taken 
                  for each sampling period at the same 4 points within each lagoon near the mouth, near the upstream 
                  edge, and on both sides of the lagoon. In addition, both particulate and dissolved parameters were 
                  determined through discrete water samples taken at the above mentioned points, plus 2 additional 
                  random points within each lagoon. These variables include dissolved nitrogen species determined 
                  using colorimetric techniques on a Skalar autoanalyzer, water column particulate chl a using the 
                  above mentioned fluorometric method, and particulate organic matter (POM) as calculated by loss on 
                  ignition (LOI). In addition to these static measurements of water quality, nitrogen loading rates 
                  for each lagoon were calculated from all likely sources, including tidal, atmospheric, and watershed 
                  inputs over the course of a year. Tidal and atmospheric inputs have been derived using our own 
                  measurements of tidal volume exchange, rainfall, and total dissolved nitrogen concentration in tidal 
                  and rainwater obtained every 6 wk from June 2003 to June 2004. Watershed inputs were derived using 
                  the model described by Valiela et al. (1997) after assessment of land use in the watersheds. We 
                  derived the error, associated with the metabolism calculations as follows. We first derived the SEs 
                  of the weighted metabolic rates calculated with Eq. (3). For each weighted rate in State Park and 
                  Kees Bayou, the standard error was derived as (Bevington 1969): SErate = (SE2 (SR × SC) + SE2 (BSR 
                  × BSC))1/2 (4) where SE(SR × SC) = [(SESR × SESC)2 + (SR × SESC)2 + (SC × SESR)2]1/2 (5) SE(BSR × 
                  BSC) = [(SEBSR × SEBSC)2 + (BSR × SEBSC)2 + (BSC × SEBSR)2]1/2 (6) and SR, SC, BSR and BSC are as 
                  explained for Eq. (3). Once the SEs were calculated, the df of each standard error was calculated 
                  using the Welch procedure (Welch 1947): df SE(SR × SC) = SE4 (SR × SC)/[(SR4 × SE4 SC/df SESC) + 
                  (SC4 × SE4 SR/df SESR)] (7) df SE(BSR × BSC) = SE4 (BSR × BSC)/[(BSR4 × SE4 BSC/df SEBSC) + (BSC4 × 
                  SE4 BSR/df SEBSR)] (8)df SErate = SE4 rate/[(SE4 (SR × SC)/df SE(SR × SC))+ (SE4 (BSR × BSC)/df 
                  SE(BSR × BSC))] (9) Second, we calculated the 99% confidence interval (CI) of the weighted rate as 
                  (Zar 1999): 99% CI = weighted rate ± t0.01 (2),df × SErate 10) where df corresponds to the result of 
                  Eq. (9) or the df of the weighted metabolic rate. Finally, we compared the weighted values and 99% 
                  CIs of GPP, R and NP across the 3 lagoons and determined if significant differences existed at a = 
                  0.01.
