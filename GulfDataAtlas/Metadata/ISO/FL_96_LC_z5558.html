<b>      Abstract: </b>
<b></b>          This data set contains the 1996-era classification of the SE Atlantic, zone 55 and zone 58, and can be used to 
          analyze change between the 1996 and 2000 classifications. This imagery was collected as part of the 
          Multi-Resolution Land Characteristics program in a multi- agency effort to provide baseline multi-scale 
          environmental characteristics and to monitor environmental change. This data set utilized full or partial 
          Landsat 5 Thematic Mapper scenes which were analyzed according to the Coastal Change Analysis Program 
          (C-CAP) protocol to determine land cover.
<b>      Purpose: </b>
<b></b>          To improve the understanding of coastal uplands and wetlands, and their linkages with the distribution, 
          abundance, and health of living marine resources.

<b>          Evaluation method description: </b>
<b></b>              While the accuracy of a 1996-era classification is hard to determine based on 2000-era ground truth, the 
              1996-era classification is composed of approximately 89.3% of the final 2000-era classification. This is 
              because only the areas of change between 1996 and 2000 were classified for the classification. Then the 
              classified layer was overlaid onto the classification. Therefore the accuracy assessment for the 
              classification is still a good estimate of the accuracy of the classification. According to accuracy 
              assessment performed by Sanborn, the overall accuracy is 81.2% and 0.793 Kappa. The accuracy results 
              shown below are from US Coastal zones 55/58. A total of 1508 points are located in US Coastal zones 
              55/58. Each class accuracy is as follows: (Errors of Omission/Commission) 0 Background (N/A) 1 
              Unclassified (Cloud, Shadow, etc)(N/A) 2 High Intensity Developed (79.2%/79.2%) 3 Medium Intensity

              (48.8%/63.6%) 10 Evergreen Forest (92.7%/96.6%) 11 Mixed Forest (40.7%/44%) 12 Scrub/Shrub (60.3%/67.7%) 
              13 Palustrine Forested Wetland (88.3%/82.5%) 14 Palustrine Scrub/Shrub Wetland (71%/72.1%) 15 Palustrine 
              Emergent Wetland (77.6%/75%) 16 Estuarine Forested Wetland (N/A) 17 Estuarine Scrub/Shrub Wetland 
              (100%/100%) 18 Estuarine Emergent Wetland (100%/95.3%) 19 Unconsolidated Shore (100%/84.8%) 20 Bare Land 
              (93.8%/77.9%) 21 Water (90.1%/100%) 22 Palustrine Aquatic Bed (100%/50%) 23 Estuarine Aquatic Bed (N/A) 
              24 Tundra (N/A) 25 Snow/Ice (N/A)
              The validation points were both collected in the field and photo interpreted. The sites were selected to 
              capture the physical and spectral diversity of the land cover. Because the starting point for this 
              classification was the NLCD data produced by the Southeast GAP, this data layer was utilized in 
              identifying potential AA sites. Segments created with Definiens software were buffered in one pixel to 
              eliminate edge effect. Segments smaller than the assessment's minimum mapping unit of 3x3 pixels were 
              eliminated. The remaining segments were summarized by the NLCD data and segments with a majority class 
              equaling less than 90% were removed. The remaining segments were entered into the pool of potential AA 
              sites. The field sampling then focused on labeling these segments with the goal being to collect a 
              minimum number of 50 samples per class with samples stratified geographically to ensure that the 
              diversity of the landscape and imagery was captured. Sites collected in the field were then verified in 
              the office using the triple date imagery to ensure consistency with all dates, and classes with less 
              than 50 samples were supplemented with photo interpreted sites. For some classes, the minimum of 50 
              sites could not be achieved and as many sites as possible were used. These classes and their actual 
              sample numbers are: Deciduous Forest (33); Mixed Forest (25); Estuarine Forested Wetland (0); Estuarine 
              Scrub/Shrub Wetland (2); Palustrine Aquatic Bed (6); Estuarine Aquatic Bed (0). These classes are either 
              rare or scattered in the area making it difficult to locate homogeneous sites for these classes. 
              Accuracy assessment sites were QC'd to ensure that edge effects, heterogeneity, and sample size would 
              not adversely affect the assessment. In addition as some of the class definitions were refined through 
              the draft review processes, the AA database was updated to reflect these changes. A total of 1,279 
              accuracy assessment points were used excluding urban classes.

<b></b>                  This section outlines the classification procedure for zones 55/58 C-CAP Early Date (1996 ERA) 
                  classification. Each Landsat TM scene was geo-referenced by USGS (United States Geological Survey) 
                  EROS Data Center. The Sanborn staff reviewed the spectral and spatial quality of the imagery with 
                  special attention paid to the early dates alignment with the late date. Areas that were greater than 
                  1-2 pixels off were sent back to USGS for reprocessing. The data was geo-referenced to Albers 
                  Conical Equal Area, with a spheroid of GRS 1980, and Datum of NAD83. Change Analysis: Once the and 
                  images were aligned, the next step was to determine the areas of change between the 1996 and 
                  2000-era data. Since the 2000-era classification was already complete, it was only necessary to 
                  classify the areas of change to create a 1996-era classification of the same specifications. Change 
                  detection was performed on each of images. A difference image was created using the six spectral 
                  bands of the leaf-on imagery and the six spectral bands of the imagery (leaf on). This difference 
                  image was clustered into 150 classes. Classes of change were recoded into one change class. In 
                  addition, change detections using the same method, were performed between the leaf-on image and the 
                  spring image, and the leaf-on image and the leaf-off image. These areas of change were added to the 
                  change mask to account for differences between the images. The change layer over-estimated change to 
                  ensure that all changed areas were captured in the mask. Classification: The classification of the , 
                  1996-era data was a mixture of automated and manual approaches. The change mask was used to identify 
                  areas in the classification that had not changed since 1996. These were considered areas that could 
                  be used to collect training points. A stratified random sample of points were selected from the 
                  non-change areas of the classification. Over 5000 training points were selected from the non-change 
                  areas. Points were reviewed to ensure that they were labeled correctly. The training points were 
                  supplemented with additional points in the areas that did change and for classes that did not have 
                  enough samples. An classification was created using this training data set in the CART discrete 
                  decision-tree software. The model was applied to a mosaic of the image pieces. The change mask was 
                  used to mask the classification. This area of change from the was compared to the same area of the 
                  classification. Illogical changes were reviewed and modeled out or to other classes when 
                  appropriate. The area of change was then reviewed against both the 1996 and 2000 era TM data to 
                  identify omitted and committed change as well as change that had gotten the wrong class call. When 
                  the manual edits were complete, the final classification was generated by using the 1996 
                  classification in areas that had changed and the 2000 classification in areas that had not changed.

                  QA/QC Process: There were several QA/QC steps involved in the creation of this product. An internal 
                  QA/QC was completed prior to each delivery. This was done by viewing the classification 
                  frame-by-frame along with the TM imagery, the classification, and high resolution reference imagery. 
                  NOAA staff completed similar reviews for each delivery and provided both general and point specific 
                  comments.
