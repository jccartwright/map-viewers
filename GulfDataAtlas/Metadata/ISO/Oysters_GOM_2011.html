<b>      Abstract: </b>
<b></b>          1985 Gulf of Mexico Atlas abstract American oyster Crassostrea virginica Ostión americano Description Range: 
          The American oyster, a bivalve mollusc of the family Ostreidae, is found in the western Atlantic from the 
          Gulf of St. Lawrence to the Yucatan Peninsula. In the Gulf, this species occurs throughout estuaries, 
          shallow nearshore waters, and on reefs located near river mouths. Habitat: Large populations of this benthic 
          invertebrate are found in the large estuarine bays and sounds of the Gulf (with most concentrations found 
          within 10-meter depths). Sedentary in character, this invertebrate attaches in clusters to shell reefs, firm 
          mud/shell bottoms and other hard substrates. Feeding and Behavior: The American oyster filter-feeds 
          principally on small unicellular algae and incidentally on suspended detrital particles. It is found in 
          association with numerous predators, commensals, and parasites. Reproduction: Spawning also occurs in 
          estuarine habitats. In the Gulf of Mexico, April to October are the most active months, although spawning 
          has been reported during all months except February and March. Nursery areas are found in estuarine waters. 
          Movement: Planktonic larvae drift with the tides and currents until they settle on solid substrate. 
          Fisheries: This species is commercially harvested throughout its range for its meat, the seasonality for 
          harvesting being state regulated. The fishery for this species is the fourth largest in the U.S. Gulf of 
          Mexico and there is also a commercial fishery in Mexican waters. The species is harvested recreationally.
<b>      Purpose: </b>
<b></b>          To display American oyster (Crassostrea virginica Ostión americano) habitats in the 2011 Gulf of Mexico

                      Abstract: oyster reef in the Colorado River delta in the eastern arm of Matagorda Bay, mapped in 
                      2007. In late February 2007, just after a northern that blew through and made the delta shallow, 
                      BIO-West had aerials flown of the delta. They digitize the aerials. Then, BIO-West went out in 
                      an airboat at high tide in the delta area and coded the oyster formations by percentage density. 
                      Melissa F. told me they coded: 0-25%, scattered shell; 25-75%, no specific label; 75-100%, solid 
                      reef. They incorporated this oyster reef data into the habitat assessment file for the Matagorda 
                      Bay Health Evaluation Project (final report 2008). Now one discrepancy- I'm looking at the table 
                      for the shapefile, and under density, I see 25, 50, 75. I'm going to assume 25 means 0-25%, 
                      scattered shell; 50 means 25-75%; and 75 means 75-100%, solid reef." Kathleen Welder HRI TAMU-CC 
                      Oyster reef distribution in and around the project area, Eastern Arm of Matagorda Bay (EAMB) and 
                      East Matagorda Bay (EMB), was previously mapped by Texas Parks and Wildlife (TPWD) and the 
                      TexasGeneral Land Office (GLO) using various sources. The MBHE project team conducted a 
                      fieldground-truthing effort in October 2005 to verify and update the distribution maps.Large 
                      areas of previously undocumented oyster reefs were identified in the immediate area ofthe new 
                      Colorado River delta (CRD) during the 2006 field activities.The extent of Eastern oyster 
                      (Crassostrea virginica) reefs in shallow waters in the vicinity of the CRD was revealed during 
                      an airboat survey of the area in the fall of 2006 and again in February 2007. The density of 
                      these reefs varied from scattered individual oyster clumps to solid oyster reef. On March 5, 
                      2007 the Colorado River Delta (CRD) area was flown and aerial photography was taken directly 
                      after a cold front had passed (when strong North winds result in extremely low water levels, 
                      exposing much of the delta bay bottom). These aerial photographs were geo-rectified and utilized 
                      in GIS form to assess the location and density of oyster reef coverage in the region. Areas 
                      possessing oyster reef coverage were digitized with ESRI ArcMap software and categorized into 
                      one of three densities: 25% coverage of scattered reef, 25-75% coverage of reef and 75% solid 
                      reef areas. Examples of these density categories as seen in the field are provided in Figures 
                      3.1, 3.2 and 3.3 of the 2007 MBHE Report. Mapped oyster reef locations and densities were 
                      verified on April 11, 2007 utilizing an airboat and a Trimble Pro XRS GPS unit with sub-meter 
                      accuracy. The final mapped extent of oyster reef in the CRD comprised 147.1 acres, which amounts 
                      to approximately 20% of the mapped oyster reef in East Matagorda Bay (EMB) and 13% of the mapped 
                      oyster reef in the Eastern Arm of Matagorda Bay (EAMB) (Figure 3.4). Of this total, 31.4 acres 
                      were classified as 25% coverage by oysters, 60.4acres were classified as 25-75% coverage by 
                      oysters, and 55.3 acres were classified as 75%coverage by oysters. The oyster coverage mapped in 
                      the CRD in 2007 was added to the final physical habitat map to provide a comprehensive map of 
                      existing physical habitat within the project area (Figure 3.5). This final habitat map serves as 
                      the physical habitat input to the GIS-based habitat model. This map also has the potential to be 
                      updated in the future, as potential changes to physical habitat in the project area occur. 
                      Purpose: To conduct the Matagorda Bay Health Evaluation habitat assessment, statistical models 
                      of oyster reef condition, and spatially referenced habitat models were generated using GIS. 
                      Fieldwork was conducted to verify previous oyster mapping from TPWD and GLO in EMB and EAMB. 
                      Fieldwork was also conducted to map the unmapped extent of oysters in the Colorado River 
                      delta(CRD) region . The new CRD oyster mapping was added to the physical habitat input file for 
                      the MBHE habitat model.During fieldwork conducted in spring 2007, data was collected on 
                      commercial size oysters and dermo infestation of reefs in the CRD and East Matagorda Bay (EMB), 
                      as was information on the use of shallow estuarine habitats by juvenile shellfish and finfish 
                      across the Matagorda Bay system. (Data was available for EAMB from another monitoring program).

                      They used their field effort and existing TPWD data to create their reef map (which was not

                      75-100%." Kathleen Welder HRI TAMU-CC Oyster reef distribution in and around the project area, 
                      Eastern Arm of Matagorda Bay (EAMB) and East Matagorda Bay (EMB), was previously mapped by Texas 
                      Parks and Wildlife (TPWD) and the TexasGeneral Land Office (GLO) using various sources. The MBHE 
                      project team conducted a fieldground-truthing effort in October 2005 to verify and update the 
                      distribution maps.Large areas of previously undocumented oyster reefs were identified in the 
                      immediate area ofthe new Colorado River delta (CRD) during the 2006 field activities.The extent 
                      of Eastern oyster (Crassostrea virginica) reefs in shallow waters in the vicinity of the CRD was 
                      revealed during an airboat survey of the area in the fall of 2006 and again in February 2007. 
                      The density of these reefs varied from scattered individual oyster clumps to solid oyster reef. 
                      On March 5, 2007 the Colorado River Delta (CRD) area was flown and aerial photography was taken 
                      directly after a cold front had passed (when strong North winds result in extremely low water 
                      levels, exposing much of the delta bay bottom). These aerial photographs were geo-rectified and 
                      utilized in GIS form to assess the location and density of oyster reef coverage in the region. 
                      Areas possessing oyster reef coverage were digitized with ESRI ArcMap software and categorized 
                      into one of three densities: 25% coverage of scattered reef, 25-75% coverage of reef and 75% 
                      solid reef areas. Examples of these density categories as seen in the field are provided in 
                      Figures 3.1, 3.2 and 3.3 of the 2007 MBHE Report. Mapped oyster reef locations and densities 
                      were verified on April 11, 2007 utilizing an airboat and a Trimble Pro XRS GPS unit with 
                      sub-meter accuracy. The final mapped extent of oyster reef in the CRD comprised 147.1 acres, 
                      which amounts to approximately 20% of the mapped oyster reef in East Matagorda Bay (EMB) and 13% 
                      of the mapped oyster reef in the Eastern Arm of Matagorda Bay (EAMB) (Figure 3.4). Of this 
                      total, 31.4 acres were classified as 25% coverage by oysters, 60.4acres were classified as 
                      25-75% coverage by oysters, and 55.3 acres were classified as 75%coverage by oysters. The oyster 
                      coverage mapped in the CRD in 2007 was added to the final physical habitat map to provide a 
                      comprehensive map of existing physical habitat within the project area (Figure 3.5). This final 
                      habitat map serves as the physical habitat input to the GIS-based habitat model. This map also 
                      has the potential to be updated in the future, as potential changes to physical habitat in the

                      Report.pdf Abstract: Oysters play an important role in maintaining water quality and providing 
                      habitat for juvenile fish, such as black drum, toadfish and sheepshead, and other marine 
                      organisms including crabs, shrimp, mud worms and mussells in estuaries (Kilgen and Dugas, 1989). 
                      It is important to understand what factors control oyster distribution to effectively maintain 
                      and manage the present oyster reefs and associated habitats. Understanding controls on 
                      distribution can also aid in oyster reef protection and restoration efforts.The American or 
                      Eastern Oyster (Crassostrea virginica) is the prevalent oyster species along the northern Gulf 
                      of Mexico coast, including Copano Bay, Texas. C. virginica has a free-swimming larval stage, 
                      lasting 14 to 30 days, after which the larva goes through a settling, or spatting process in 
                      which it must permanently attach itself to the bottom (Kennedy, 1996). During the larval stage, 
                      the oyster is susceptible to the multitude of estuarine hydrodynamic processes that distribute 
                      the larva throughout the estuary. C. virginica is a filter feeder, so it needs to settle and 
                      attach to a site which will permanently keep it out of the fine bay bottom mud to avoid 
                      suffocation by fine-grained sediment. It also needs to settle within the intertidal to subtidal 
                      portion of the bay, to allow it access to tidal flow and nutrients (Kennedy, 1996). Over the 
                      course of history in Texas bay systems, the oysters have been able to accumulate and form reefs 
                      in areas that are favorable to their success. Copano Bay is an "upper bay" system within the 
                      Mission-Aransas-Copano Bay system (Figure 1). Copano Bay has undergone very little modification, 
                      it has no dredged navigational channels and in general lacks significant infrastructural 
                      modifications found in other bays, such as Galveston, Corpus Christi or Lavaca Bays. As a 
                      result, it is an ideal setting to investigate the natural controls on oyster reef distribution. 
                      The oyster reefs in Copano Bay appear to consist of longitudinal reefs attached to the shoreline 
                      extending perpendicularly into the bay, longitudinal reefs in the middle of the bay oriented 
                      parallel to shoreline and patch reefs that are randomly oriented throughout the bay. Surficial 
                      sediments contained within Copano Bay consist primarily of unconsolidated muds, sands, and shell 
                      gravel. With the lack of obvious controls on the distribution of oyster reefs, such as rock 
                      outcrops, the big question is, what does control their distribution? It is our contention that 
                      the natural distribution of oyster reefs in Copano Bay are controlled mainly by the antecedent 
                      geology found beneath the bay sediment. Oysters will form in areas where there exists shallow, 
                      hard substrate ideal for oyster attachment. Studying the underlying geology of oyster reefs 
                      could have major implications on understanding their distribution. This study will have 
                      significant implications for the future research and resource management in Copano Bay, such as 
                      oyster reef protection and restoration. Restored reefs can be placed in areas where known stable 
                      underlying geology is present to ensure the reef is successful and the oysters not subside into 
                      the soft bay mud and become suffocated by fined grained sediment particles. If large extents of 
                      buried oyster reefs are found, this could indicate an enormous decline in oyster reef population 
                      over time and actions could be taken to prevent any further decline from happening.Copano Bay 
                      has undergone very little modification, it has no dredged navigational channels and in general 
                      lacks significant infrastructural modifications found in other bays, such as Galveston, Corpus 
                      Christi or Lavaca Bays. As a result, it is an ideal setting to investigate the natural controls 
                      on oyster reef distribution. The oyster reefs in Copano Bayappear to consist of longitudinal 
                      reefs attached to the shoreline extending perpendicularly into the bay, longitudinal reefs in 
                      the middle of the bay oriented parallel to shoreline and patch reefs that are randomly oriented 
                      throughout the bay. Surficial sediments contained within Copano Bay consist primarily 
                      ofunconsolidated muds, sands, and shell gravel. With the lack of obvious controls on the 
                      distribution of oyster reefs, such as rock outcrops, the big question is, what does control 
                      their distribution? It is our contention that the natural distribution of oyster reefs in Copano 
                      Bay are controlled mainly by the antecedent geology found beneath the bay sediment.Oysters will 
                      form in areas where there exists shallow, hard substrate ideal for oyster attachment. Studying 
                      the underlying geology of oyster reefs could have major implications on understanding their 
                      distribution. This study will have significant implications for the future research and resource 
                      management in Copano Bay, such as oyster reef protection and restoration. Restored reefs can be 
                      placed in areas where known stable underlying geology is present to ensure the reef is 
                      successful and the oysters not subside into the soft bay mud and become suffocated by fined 
                      grained sediment particles. If large extents of buried oyster reefs are found, this could 
                      indicate an enormous decline in oyster reef population over time and actions could be taken to 
                      prevent any further decline from happening. Purpose: For the purpose of this study, the 
                      substrate type will be considered the most important influencefor the initial distribution of 
                      oyster reefs. Regardless of other environmental conditions, the substratemust be suitable for 
                      initial oyster colonization or the oyster will not survive. Where there are oyster reefspresent 
                      in the geologic past, there was adequate substrate for initial settlement. Adequate 
                      substrateincludes any hard, smooth surface such as compacted mud, sand or shell shoals, lose 
                      shell or sunken logs.Loose sand or mud can shift and break the oyster free of its anchor, or 
                      bury and suffocate it (Kennedy,1996). The ideal substrate for larval oysters has been found to 
                      be existing reef or oyster shells (Kilgen andDugas 1989; Stanley and Sellers 1986; Michener and 
                      Kenny 1991; Kennedy, 1996). Some current oysterreefs are most likely built on top of reefs that 
                      initially grew thousands of years ago when the incisedpaleo-river valleys began to fill with 
                      sediment (Bouma, 1976). The oyster reefs build up vertically andout horizontally with new 
                      oysters growing atop older ones. Ideally, without significant outside physicalinfluences to move 
                      them, the present day oyster reefs would exist in the same general locations as wherethey were 
                      initially colonized, only to a larger extent. However, oyster reefs do not only build atop 
                      otherreefs. If suitable substrate is formed or becomes available elsewhere, larvae will also 
                      settle atop itforming a new reef. Therefore each reef in the current oyster reef distribution 
                      may have differentgeologic controls. Supplemental Information: This is the final report of our 
                      CMP Cycle 12 project to identify and delineate oyster reefsand other bottom features in Copano

                      Report.pdfAbstract: Oysters play an important role in maintaining water quality and providing 
                      habitat for juvenile fish, such as black drum, toadfish and sheepshead, and other marine 
                      organisms including crabs, shrimp, mud worms and mussells in estuaries (Kilgen and Dugas, 1989). 
                      It is important to understand what factors control oyster distribution to effectively maintain 
                      and manage the present oyster reefs and associated habitats. Understanding controls on 
                      distribution can also aid in oyster reef protection and restoration efforts.The American or 
                      Eastern Oyster (Crassostrea virginica) is the prevalent oyster species along the northern Gulf 
                      of Mexico coast, including Copano Bay, Texas. C. virginica has a free-swimming larval stage, 
                      lasting 14 to 30 days, after which the larva goes through a settling, or spatting process in 
                      which it must permanently attach itself to the bottom (Kennedy, 1996). During the larval stage, 
                      the oyster is susceptible to the multitude of estuarine hydrodynamic processes that distribute 
                      the larva throughout the estuary. C. virginica is a filter feeder, so it needs to settle and 
                      attach to a site which will permanently keep it out of the fine bay bottom mud to avoid 
                      suffocation by fine-grained sediment. It also needs to settle within the intertidal to subtidal 
                      portion of the bay, to allow it access to tidal flow and nutrients (Kennedy, 1996). Over the 
                      course of history in Texas bay systems, the oysters have been able to accumulate and form reefs 
                      in areas that are favorable to their success. Copano Bay is an "upper bay" system within the 
                      Mission-Aransas-Copano Bay system (Figure 1). Copano Bay has undergone very little modification, 
                      it has no dredged navigational channels and in general lacks significant infrastructural 
                      modifications found in other bays, such as Galveston, Corpus Christi or Lavaca Bays. As a 
                      result, it is an ideal setting to investigate the natural controls on oyster reef distribution. 
                      The oyster reefs in Copano Bay appear to consist of longitudinal reefs attached to the shoreline 
                      extending perpendicularly into the bay, longitudinal reefs in the middle of the bay oriented 
                      parallel to shoreline and patch reefs that are randomly oriented throughout the bay. Surficial 
                      sediments contained within Copano Bay consist primarily of unconsolidated muds, sands, and shell 
                      gravel. With the lack of obvious controls on the distribution of oyster reefs, such as rock 
                      outcrops, the big question is, what does control their distribution? It is our contention that 
                      the natural distribution of oyster reefs in Copano Bay are controlled mainly by the antecedent 
                      geology found beneath the bay sediment. Oysters will form in areas where there exists shallow, 
                      hard substrate ideal for oyster attachment. Studying the underlying geology of oyster reefs 
                      could have major implications on understanding their distribution. This study will have 
                      significant implications for the future research and resource management in Copano Bay, such as 
                      oyster reef protection and restoration. Restored reefs can be placed in areas where known stable 
                      underlying geology is present to ensure the reef is successful and the oysters not subside into 
                      the soft bay mud and become suffocated by fined grained sediment particles. If large extents of 
                      buried oyster reefs are found, this could indicate an enormous decline in oyster reef population 
                      over time and actions could be taken to prevent any further decline from happening.Copano Bay 
                      has undergone very little modification, it has no dredged navigational channels and in general 
                      lacks significant infrastructural modifications found in other bays, such as Galveston, Corpus 
                      Christi or Lavaca Bays. As a result, it is an ideal setting to investigate the natural controls 
                      on oyster reef distribution. The oyster reefs in Copano Bayappear to consist of longitudinal 
                      reefs attached to the shoreline extending perpendicularly into the bay, longitudinal reefs in 
                      the middle of the bay oriented parallel to shoreline and patch reefs that are randomly oriented 
                      throughout the bay. Surficial sediments contained within Copano Bay consist primarily 
                      ofunconsolidated muds, sands, and shell gravel. With the lack of obvious controls on the 
                      distribution of oyster reefs, such as rock outcrops, the big question is, what does control 
                      their distribution? It is our contention that the natural distribution of oyster reefs in Copano 
                      Bay are controlled mainly by the antecedent geology found beneath the bay sediment.Oysters will 
                      form in areas where there exists shallow, hard substrate ideal for oyster attachment. Studying 
                      the underlying geology of oyster reefs could have major implications on understanding their 
                      distribution. This study will have significant implications for the future research and resource 
                      management in Copano Bay, such as oyster reef protection and restoration. Restored reefs can be 
                      placed in areas where known stable underlying geology is present to ensure the reef is 
                      successful and the oysters not subside into the soft bay mud and become suffocated by fined 
                      grained sediment particles. If large extents of buried oyster reefs are found, this could 
                      indicate an enormous decline in oyster reef population over time and actions could be taken to 
                      prevent any further decline from happening.Purpose: For the purpose of this study, the substrate 
                      type will be considered the most important influencefor the initial distribution of oyster 
                      reefs. Regardless of other environmental conditions, the substratemust be suitable for initial 
                      oyster colonization or the oyster will not survive. Where there are oyster reefspresent in the 
                      geologic past, there was adequate substrate for initial settlement. Adequate substrateincludes 
                      any hard, smooth surface such as compacted mud, sand or shell shoals, lose shell or sunken 
                      logs.Loose sand or mud can shift and break the oyster free of its anchor, or bury and suffocate 
                      it (Kennedy,1996). The ideal substrate for larval oysters has been found to be existing reef or 
                      oyster shells (Kilgen andDugas 1989; Stanley and Sellers 1986; Michener and Kenny 1991; Kennedy, 
                      1996). Some current oysterreefs are most likely built on top of reefs that initially grew 
                      thousands of years ago when the incisedpaleo-river valleys began to fill with sediment (Bouma, 
                      1976). The oyster reefs build up vertically andout horizontally with new oysters growing atop 
                      older ones. Ideally, without significant outside physicalinfluences to move them, the present 
                      day oyster reefs would exist in the same general locations as wherethey were initially 
                      colonized, only to a larger extent. However, oyster reefs do not only build atop otherreefs. If 
                      suitable substrate is formed or becomes available elsewhere, larvae will also settle atop 
                      itforming a new reef. Therefore each reef in the current oyster reef distribution may have 
                      differentgeologic controls.Supplemental Information: This is the final report of our CMP Cycle

                      meters. Then points were randomly selected ineach grid using GIS for each mapped category, for a 
                      total of 155 survey sites. We used a stratified designselecting 50 sites in the Oyster Reef 
                      category, 31 on Mud, 20 on Sand, and 10 each on Shell on Mud andShell on Sand.At each each 
                      station physico-chemical data (depth, water temperature, dissolved oxygen, percentsaturation, 
                      pH, salinity), secchi depth, wind speed and direction, and sea state data were collected. For 
                      theoyster dredge collections we employed the data collection procedures employed by the TPWD 
                      CoastalFisheries Division for their oyster population surveys (TPWD, 2002). This includes, in 
                      addition to countsof live oysters and dead shell, a count of live spat on five live oysters and 
                      five dead shells, plus the lengthsof up to 19 live oysters are measured.An initial analysis of 
                      the data (UNIVARIATE; SAS, 1990) determined that the count data for liveoysters and dead shell 
                      was not normally distributed as there was an abundance of zero values. Ananalysis of variance 
                      (ANOVA) was performed on the ranked count data for both live oysters and deadshell. Then a Tukey 
                      type multiple comparison was performed on the map classification categories forboth the live 
                      oyster and dead shell (Zar, 1999). These analyses were performed on both the originalvalidation 
                      data and the supplemented validation data with the adjusted map classification categories.

                      To address the issues of concern, and in response to the requirements of the Coastal 
                      Coordination Act, the Coastal Coordination Council has designated Oyster Reefs as a coastal 
                      natural resource area requiring special management under the Coastal Management Program and 
                      defined as Natural or artificial formations in intertidal or subtidal areas that are composed of 
                      oyster shell, live oysters, and other organisms and that are discrete contiguous, and clearly 
                      distinguishable from scattered oysters. Oyster reefs not only support the oyster fishery but 
                      also serve as habitat, forage ground, or hiding places for numerous estuarine species. Purpose: 
                      The oysters data set is a compilation of three data sets. The firs data set was developed by Dr. 
                      Eric Powell of Texas A&amp;M University's Department of Oceanography under the auspices of the 
                      Galveston Bay National Estuary Program. The reefs were mapped using acoustic equipment designed 
                      to return echo signal from the bay bottom. In very shallow areas where a smaller boat was used, 
                      it was not possible to hang the equipment over the side of the boat; therefore a poling 
                      technique was used to determine the location of the oyster reefs. The second and third data sets 
                      were both acquired from the Texas Parks and Wildlife Department. One was developed by a team led 
                      by Warren Pulich and used aerials circa 1989. The other was developed by Betsi Blair which also 
                      used aerial photographs and surveyed submerged aquatic vegetation including oyster reefs.

                      sabayoysters files which are included in this dataset.To address the issues of concern, and in 
                      response to the requirements of the Coastal Coordination Act, the Coastal Coordination Council 
                      has designated Oyster Reefs as a coastal natural resource area requiring special management 
                      under the Coastal Management Program and defined as Natural or artificial formations in 
                      intertidal or subtidal areas that are composed of oyster shell, live oysters, and other 
                      organisms and that are discrete contiguous, and clearly distinguishable from scatter-ed oysters. 
                      Oyster reefs not only support the oyster fishery but also serve as habitat, forage ground, or 
                      hiding places for numerous estuarine species. Purpose: For mapping at a scale of 1:24000 or 
                      smaller Access: Free to public.
