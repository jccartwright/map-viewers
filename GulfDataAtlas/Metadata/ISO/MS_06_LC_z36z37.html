<b>      Abstract: </b>
<b></b>          This is a final classification. It is ready for distribution pending review by NOAA-CSC staff. This data set 
          is the pre-hurricane Katrina 2006-era classification of the US Gulf Coast, zones 36 and 37. This data set 
          utilized 18 full or partial Landsat 5 Thematic Mapper scenes which were analyzed according to the Coastal 
          Change Analysis Program (C-CAP) protocol to determine land cover.
<b>      Purpose: </b>
<b></b>          To improve the understanding of coastal uplands and wetlands, and their linkages with the distribution, 
          abundance, and health of living marine resources.

              latitude/longitude window contain data. Conversion and integration with vector files indicates that all 
              positions are consistent with earth coordinates covering the same area. Attribute files are logically 
              consistent.

<b>              Description: </b>
<b></b>                  This dataset was created by MDA Federal. This classification is based on 2006-era Landsat TM imagery 
                  for areas of 2001-2005 change. The study area is zones 36 and 37 of the Gulf Coast. The 2000-era 
                  C-CAP classification available for the same area was updated using 2006-era imagery. Change 
                  detection analysis was performed to create a layer showing areas of change between 2000 and 2005. 
                  The change area was then classified and overlaid on the 2000-era dataset.
                  Pre-processing steps: Each Landsat TM scene was geo-referenced by USGS (United States Geological 
                  Survey) EROS Data Center. Then MDA Federal staff verified the scenes for spatial accuracy to within 
                  2 pixels. The data was geo-referenced to Albers Conical Equal Area, with a spheroid of GRS 1980, and 
                  Datum of WGS84. The data units is in meters. Single scene, 2000- and 2005-date imagery was received 
                  by MDA Federal from USGS-EDC (EROS Data Center) for use in this classification procedure. 
                  At-satellite reflectance was performed on each scene and the tasseled cap transformation applied. 
                  When possible, leaf-off 2005 imagery was selected for use. Where 2005 cloud-free imagery was not 
                  available, scenes from 2004 were used. All of the image data used was Landsat TM 5 or 7. The first 
                  step of the process was to remove clouds/cloud shadows from the 2005 imagery. Cloud/cloud shadow 
                  areas were filled with imagery from another 2006-era scene to create cloud-free imagery for zones 36 
                  and 37. The tasseled cap scenes were mosaicked to create a continuous zones 36 and 37 dataset which 
                  was used for classification. The individual scenes were used for change detection.
                  Change Detection: The next step was to determine the areas of change between 2000 and 2006-era data. 
                  The change detection algorithm used is the Cross Correlation Analysis process (CCA) developed at MDA 
                  Federal. This copyrighted procedure produced 2 Z-score files per scene of likelihood of change. 
                  These files were thresholded and mosaicked to create a binary change layer for that scene. In 
                  addition to the CCA process, a model was used to determine the differences between the 2000 and 2005 
                  tasseled-cap layers. This layer was used to check for change areas that were not completely 
                  extracted by the CCA process. All of the binary files were mosaicked to create a change layer for 
                  the entire study area. A focal majority was run on the change layer to fill in some clumps to make 
                  sure all of the change was accounted for. The change layer is a slight over-estimation of change to 
                  make sure to include as much change as possible.
                  Classification: The classification of the change areas was a mixture of automated and manual 
                  approaches. The change areas were removed from the 2000 classification. The areas with no change 
                  between 2000 and 2005 were used as training for a Classification and Regression tree (CART)analysis 
                  of the changed areas. Modelling and hand-editing were used to further refine the CART output and 
                  create a final classification. The classified change areas were overlaid on the 2000 C-CAP product 
                  to create a 2005 C-CAP classification. Attributes for this product are as follows:

<b>                Definition: </b>
<b></b>                    Characterized by substrates lacking vegetation except for pioneering plants that become established 
                    during brief periods when growing conditions are favorable. Erosion and deposition by waves and 
                    currents produce a number of landforms, such as beaches, bars, and flats, all of which are 
                    included in this class.
