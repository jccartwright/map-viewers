<b>      Abstract: </b>
<b></b>          The data presented here are summarized from annual National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS), Southeast 
          Fisheries Science Center (SEFSC) fishery independent Bottom Longline Surveys.The surveys were started in 
          1995, to assess the distribution and abundance of large and small coastal sharks across their known or 
          suspected ranges. The fishing depths were selected based on commercial shark fishing log summaries, which 
          indicated that the primary depths of effort were 18-73 m (10 to 40 fm). A random stratified sampling design 
          with three depth strata; 18-36 m (10-20 fm), 36-55 m (20-30 fm) and 55-73 m (30-40 fm) were used and uniform 
          effort across contiguous 60 nautical mile sampling zones was achieved. Based on analysis of the first two 
          survey years, the 1997 survey was modified by eliminating depth stratification and changing the survey 
          depths to 10-55 m (5-30 fm). The depth reduction was at the request of the SEFSC to ensure that the full 
          range of several coastal sharks was encompassed by the survey. Elimination of depth stratification was to 
          avoid over-sampling strata which represented the least available habitat (the 30-40 fm strata represented 
          very little of the available bottom, but was receiving 33% of the effort). A significant event in the 
          evolution of our longline surveys occurred in 1999 when we were requested to implement a longline survey 
          targeting red snapper (Lutjanus campechanus). At the time, red snapper were not specifically targeted as 
          part of the shark surveys; a different hook type (circle hook) was used, and different depth strata were 
          sampled. The snapper work was conducted between 64-146 m (35-80 fm) in an area from east of the Mississippi 
          River to south of Perdido Key, Florida. Random sampling without proportional allocation was used and 
          sampling units were 10 nautical mile blocks given the small geographical area to be covered. In 2001, the 
          shark and red snapper surveys were combined into a single annual survey of the U.S. Gulf of Mexico. 
          Proportional allocation based on shelf width within statistical zones was adopted and the survey was 
          stratified by depth with 50% allocation in 9-55 m, 40% allocation from 55-183 m and 10% allocation from 
          188-366 m. This allocation provided effort in the 9-55 m strata comparable to that achieved in previous 
          shark surveys, thereby preserving the time series back to 1995. The major change in the shark surveys was 
          adoption of the Circle hook as the standard for these surveys. A small longline spool holds approximately 5 
          nautical mile 4.0 mm diameter monofilament line (900 - 1200 lb; 401.8 - 535.7 kg test); up to 10 nautical 
          miles for large spools. Prior to bottom longline deployment, the mainline is attached to a high flyer (radar 
          reflecting buoy). High flyers are attached at both ends of the deployed mainline for visual reference and to 
          facilitate gear retrieval. As the bottom longline is deployed the vesselâ€™s GPS is used to determine distance 
          covered. Because of the constant cutting and reattachment of the mainline and potential loss of sections of 
          line over the course of a survey, the mainline is not marked in sections and the length of mainline deployed 
          is based on GPS intervals. One-hundred gangions (monofilament leaders with AK snap attachment clip and hook) 
          are attached to 1 nautical mile of mainline approximately equidistantly (about every 60 ft or 31 m) 
          throughout the set. Gangion spacing is determined by GPS (i.e., at 1/10 nautical mile 10 evenly spaced 
          gangions should have been deployed) and nautical mile increments are relayed to the gear set crew by 
          hand-held 2-way radios. An electronic beeper (interval based on vessel speed) is often used to determine 
          component attachment intervals. Weights (5 - 10 kg) are attached to the beginning, middle and end of the 
          bottom longline to prevent gear from rising in the water column, as well as to minimize horizontal movement. 
          After the end weight is attached to the bottom longline gear, the mainline is cut and attached to the second 
          high flyer. Prior to the gear haul back, the mainline is reattached to the remaining line on the spool. Buoy 
          lines (or drop lines) are continuations of the mainline and are not separate gear components but are created 
          by deploying an adequate amount of mainline monofilament for tethering high flyer buoys to the bottom 
          longline gear. Buoys/high flyers are used only on the distal ends without a mid-set buoy. To properly 
          calculate catch per unit effort (CPUE) and a variety of additional statistical analyses, it is important to 
          document longline set, gear soak and longline haul back events. There are 4 critical events; first high 
          flyer deployed (beginning of the set), last high flyer deployed (end of the set), first high flyer retrieved 
          (beginning of haul back) and last high flyer retrieved (end of haul back). Minimum data elements required 
          for each event are the date, time, bottom depth, latitude and longitude. Standard sets are 1 hr in duration 
          with 100 hooks attached along 1 nautical mile of mainline. There are a number of situations that can affect 
          the haul back duration including; high catch rates where data reporting requirements and tagging necessitate 
          slowing the retrieval process, large fish entangling gangions and other gear components, gear entanglement 
          with bottom obstructions and turtle encounters. If the haul back is delayed, some of the hooks deployed near 
          the end of the set soak for more than the 1 hr standard. However, since the time event is recorded for the 
          final high flyer brought aboard to end the haul back, extended haul back times are documented. Gear soak 
          time is an important element in calculating fishing effort (catch per unit effort, CPUE, expressed as the 
          number of captures by species/100 hook hr). Soak time is defined during SEFSC surveys, and often for other 
          surveys, as the time between deployment of the last high flyer to end the set to the time of retrieval of 
          the first high flyer to begin haul back. Since the beginning and end of the soak period are essential data 
          elements, soaks that deviate from the standard 1 hr can be accounted for during data analysis. It is 
          possible to use critical events for re-evaluating effort calculations if needed since the 4 critical events 
          are data elements (begin set, end set, begin haul back and end haul back). Ideally, sets are conducted 
          parallel to depth contours with reasonable effort made to maintain a uniform bottom depth and vessel speed 
          throughout the set. Maintaining a uniform set depth can be difficult and may not be feasible when setting 
          gear along areas of high relief or in high winds or currents. Gear is set from the stern of the vessel and 
          communications between the deck crew and helmsman are maintained via hand held two-way radios. Set 
          procedures are generally standard and should be maintained for consistent effort. Primary set procedures and 
          events include; wheel house to deck notification of the set event, deploying the first high flyer, 
          attachment of the first weight, attaching gangions at approximately equidistant increments, attachment of 
          the mid-weight, completing gangion deployment, attaching the last weight, and deploying the last high flyer 
          to mark the set termination point. Data is summarized here from all Bottom Longline Survey stations fished 
          with circle hooks from 2000 to 2009 by 15 minute longitude by latitude blocks in which sampling occurred. 
          CPUE (number/100 hook hr) data is summarized here from all Bottom Longline Survey stations fished with 
          circle hooks from 2000 to 2009 by 15 minute longitude by latitude blocks in which sampling occurred.

<b>              Description: </b>
<b></b>                  Fishery-independent catch data from Southeast Area Monitoring and Assessment Program (SEAMAP) Summer 
                  and Fall Shrimp/Groundfish Surveys (1987 - 2009) 40 foot trawls with 1.63 inch mesh are used to map 
                  the distribution, abundance and occurrence of juvenile red snapper (Lutjanus campechanus). Catches 
                  of red snapper were standardized to account for sampling effort (CPUE) and expressed as the number 
                  of fish per 1 hour tow. Mean catch per unit effort (CPUE) was then summarized by 10 minute longitude 
                  by latitude blocks in which trawling occurred.
