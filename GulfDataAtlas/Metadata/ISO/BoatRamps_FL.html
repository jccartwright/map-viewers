<b>      Abstract: </b>
<b></b>          Descriptive inventory of public access boat ramps throughout Florida, derived from raw data produced during 
          the Florida Boating Access Facilities Inventory and Economic Study, FWC contract Number 04/05-23, product 
          delivered August 30, 2009. This data set is modified from the original format and supplemented by additional 
          data maintained by FWC. These data will eventually evolve into a planned integrated boating access 
          facilities inventory system. This data set is a selection of facilities from the raw data set that the 
          contractor identified to be in operation and accessible to the general public during the time of data 
          compilation. This data set includes both government managed facilities accessible to the general public and 
          commerciality operated facilities accessible to the general public. In both cases a fee might be charged for 
          use of the facility. The attribute fields included in this data set are a subset of those available in the 
          raw data set. These attribute fields were selected and modified to present only attribute information that 
          might be of most interest to the general public desiring to use these facilities. This modified data set is 
          meant to be an interim data set for public dissemination until a more robust database application is 
          constructed to provide interactive access to the original data via web services. Currently these data are 
          considered preliminary and are not verified by FWC as to accuracy and completeness.
<b>      Purpose: </b>
<b></b>          The original data set was produced during the Statewide Boating Access Facilities Inventory and Economic 
          Study, FWC contract Number 04/05-23 and delivered by the contractor August 30, 2009. The purpose of that 
          study was to create a comprehensive inventory of publicly accessible boat access facilities and conduct 
          several economic studies to quantify economic impact of recreational boating; estimate present and projected 
          supply/demand; conduct site suitability analysis for potential or expanded facilities; and estimate capital 
          costs for new or improved facilities.
<b>      Credit: </b>
<b></b>          Funded by a grant from the United States Fish and Wildlife Service Federal Aid in Sport Fish Restoration 
          Program awarded to the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission. The overlying project is titled 
          Florida Boating Access Facilities Inventory and Economic Study. Original data compilation conducted under 
          sub-contract to the Urban Harbors Institute at the University of Massachusetts through contract number FWC 
          04/05-23 and product delivered August 30, 2009. Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission, United 
          States Fish and Wildlife Service, and Lee County commissioned the body of work from which these data are 
          derived. The University of Massachusetts at Boston Urban Harbors Institute was lead contractor. Bordner 
          Research Associates conducted field inspections. The project was commissioned in 2005 and titled the Florida 
          Boating and Access Facilities Inventory and Economic Study.
