<b></b>              Further information for the Automated Wreck and Obstruction Information System (AWOIS) can be found in the 
              AWOIS User's Guide 2002.
<b>      Abstract: </b>
<b></b>          The Automated Wreck and Obstruction Information System (AWOIS) is an automated file that contains information 
          on wrecks and obstructions, and other significant charted features in coastal waters of the United States 
          subject to NOS Hydrographic Surveys. Items in this file are individually catalogued and are accompanied by 
          historic and descriptive information gathered from field observations and Government and private 
          publications. Approximately 96% of the items have a position in latitude and longitude (NAD83), original 
          datum information, a position accuracy code, a source quality code, a charted symbol code, a chart number, 
          and project information. Each item has also been evaluated for the adequacy of the available information as 
          it relates to future surveys and nautical charting activities and may carry a specific recommendation for 
          the type of survey investigation required to improve the quality of known information.
<b>      Purpose: </b>
<b></b>          AWOIS was implemented to catalogue and store a substantial volume of reported wrecks and obstructions that are 
          considered navigational hazards within U.S. coastal waters. The AWOIS database is updated prior to 
          hydrographic surveys to identify potential features that require furthur study. Besides functioning as a 
          survey planning tool, AWOIS is of potential value to users outside of the National Ocean Service. The 
          historical record of selected wrecks and obstructions, the accessibility of information in a sorted format, 
          and its reasonable cost make AWOIS an important information source for marine archaeologists and historians, 
          fishermen, divers, salvage operators, and others in the marine community.

<b>          Evaluation method description: </b>
<b></b>              The geographic position represents the most accurate position available found in documents at NOS. The 
              coordinate position is presented in its original datum and corrected to NAD83. Other positions in the 
              History memo field are for reference purposes only and will be superseded by the Header Record position. 
              Users should be aware that the AWOIS position may not agree with the charted position for a similar 
              feature. Most of these differences are minor and due to the fact that the paper chart cannot always show 
              a location as accurately as a digital list. Other more significant differences are generally due to a 
              time lag in updating either a chart or AWOIS. Each datum corrected coordinate position is provided with 
              a qualitative accuracy rating of high, medium, low, and poor which is reflective of the original source 
              from which the data were obtained. High A high quality coordinate position originating from survey 
              source or whenever there is a high level of confidence that the wreck or obstruction may be relocated 
              without unreasonable difficulty. Although most positions in this category originate with NOS surveys, 
              other sources may qualify. It is important that the position be appropriately reported. As a general 
              rule, it has been found that positions expressed without partial seconds may be classified with a lower 
              accuracy code. Medium A probable high quality position lacking supporting documentation or a lower 
              quality survey position obtained by such means as seefieldsheet techniques. Positions originating from 
              nonagency sources may also be in this category if the location is tightly controlled by adjacent 
              features such as pier lines or fixed aids to navigation. A report that the wreck or obstruction has been 
              actually located by the Coast Guard or Corps of Engineers will usually qualify a position for this 
              category. Low A position of questionable or unverified quality. Most reports from Local Notice to

<b>          Measure description: </b>
<b></b>              AWOIS is not a comprehensive record of wrecks or obstructions in any particular area. Historical research 
              is constantly being conducted to improve the quality of the file, but it will never completely address 
              every known or reported wreck or obstruction. The emphasis is constantly placed on wrecks and 
              obstructions which may be a hazard to navigation.

<b>              Description: </b>
<b></b>                  In 1981, the National Ocean Service (NOS) implemented the Automated Wreck and Obstruction Information 
                  System (AWOIS) to assist in planning hydrographic survey operations and to catalog and store a 
                  substantial volume of reported wrecks and obstructions that are considered navigational hazards 
                  within U.S. coastal waters. Today, over 10,000 reports have been received, which include unverified 
                  accounts of vessel casualties, as well as chronological history. As part of the hydrographic survey 
                  planning process, these records are reviewed and those wrecks or obstructions which require 
                  additional field investigation are assigned to specific field units. The results of these 
                  investigations eventually become part of the AWOIS file so that a permanent record of a wreck or 
                  obstruction is always available. If the hydrographic survey cannot locate a particular item in its 
                  designated survey area, the item remains in the AWOIS database but is removed from the appropriate 
                  nautical chart.
