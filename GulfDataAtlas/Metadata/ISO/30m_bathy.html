<b>      Abstract: </b>
<b></b>          These Bathymetric Digital Elevation Models (DEM) were generated from original point soundings collected during 
          hydrographic surveys conducted by the National Ocean Service and its predecessors. Mean High Water shoreline 
          as defined by NOAA nautical charts was used as a constraining boundary and assigned its local elevation 
          relative to the local datum (typically Mean Low Water). DEM grid values outside the shoreline (on land) were 
          assigned null values (-32676). In the event of multiple surveys in a region, the most recent survey 
          soundings were retained. Both 7.5 minute and 1 degree DEMs are available. The 1 degree DEMs were generated 
          from the higher resolution 7.5 minute DEMs which covered the estuary. A Digital Elevation Model (DEM) 
          contains a series of elevations ordered from south to north with the order of the columns from west to east. 
          The DEM is formatted as one ASCII header record (A- record), followed by a series of profile records (B- 
          records) each of which include a short B-record header followed by a series of ASCII integer elevations 
          (typically in units of 1 centimeter {0.01 meter]) per each profile. The last physical record of the DEM is 
          an accuracy record (C-record). The 7.5-minute DEM (30- by 30-m data spacing) is cast on the Universal 
          Transverse Mercator (UTM) projection. It provides coverage in 7.5- by 7.5-minute blocks. Each product 
          provides the same coverage as a standard USGS 7.5-minute quadrangle but the DEM contains over edge data. 
          Coverage is available for many estuaries of the contiguous United States but is not complete.
<b>      Purpose: </b>
<b></b>          Bathymetric DEM's can be used as layers in Geographic Information Systems (GIS) for earth science analysis. 
          DEM's can also serve as tools for volumetric analysis, for site location of structures, or for drainage 
          basin delineation. The source soundings are collected by the NOS Office of Coast Survey (OCS).

              from these data. The datum for these bathymetric DEMs is not the same as that used by the US Geological 
              survey (USGS) for land based DEMs which results in a discontinuity if the two datasets are merged

              the Bathymetric DEMs. The data within the bathymetry file is floating point. When using the data within 
              a GIS care must be taken to ensure that the data are being read as floating point and not integer data. 
              Distribution Liability: Although these data have been processed successfully on a computer system at the 
              National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, no warranty expressed or implied is made by NOAA 
              regarding the utility of the data on any other system, nor shall the act of distribution constitute any 
              such warranty. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration will warrant the delivery of this 
              product in computer-readable format and will offer appropriate adjustment of credit when the product is 
              determined unreadable by correctly adjusted computer input peripherals, or when the physical medium is 
              delivered in damaged condition. Requests for adjustment of credit must be made within 90 days from the 
              date of this shipment from the ordering site.

<b>      Supplemental Information: </b>
<b></b>          The datum for these bathymetric DEMs is not the same as that used by the
<PRE wrap="">          			 United States Geological Survey (USGS) for land based DEMs which
          			results in a discontinuity if the two datasets are merged together.
          			Moreover, the shoreline for the USGS DEMs is indeterminate and not the
          			same as that used for the Bathymetric DEMs.  Because of these
          			differences, extreme care should be used in merging NOAA and USGS DEM
          			data.
          
          			7.5-minute DEMs have rows and columns which vary in length and are
          			staggered.  The UTM bounding coordinates form a quadrilateral (no two
          			sides are parallel to each other), rather than a rectangle.  The user
          			will need to pad out the uneven rows and columns with blanks or flagged
          			data values, if a rectangle is required for the user's application.
          			Some software vendors have incorporated this function into their
          			software for input of standard formatted USGS DEMs.
          
          			The data within the bathymetry file is floating point.  When using the
          			data within a GIS care must be taken to ensure that the data are being
          			read as floating point and not integer data.

<b>          Evaluation method description: </b>
<b></b>              The horizontal accuracy of the DEM is expressed as an estimated root mean square error (RMSE). The 
              estimate of the RMSE is based upon horizontal accuracy tests of the source soundings used to generate 
              the DEM. As a first approximation the locational accuracy of the source soundings are 0.0015 m at source 
              "Smooth Sheet" scale (120 m @ 1:80,000 to 15 m @ 1:10,000). Smooth Sheets are maps generated as a 
              principle product of each (historic) hydrographic survey with fully corrected soundings plotted on them.

<b>          Name of measure: </b>
<b></b>              Vertical Positional Accuracy
<b>          Evaluation method description: </b>
<b></b>              The vertical RMSE statistic is used to describe the vertical accuracy of a DEM. It encompasses both random 
              and systematic errors introduced during production of the data. The RMSE is encoded in element number 5 
              of record C of the DEM. This accuracy estimate includes components related to quantization of the source 
              soundings (1.3 to 0.15 m), the systematic editing of the source data (1% or 0.10m), un-sampled 
              bathymetric features (estimated at less than 5% of depth), time related changes (erosion, deposition, 
              and seismic shifts), and dredging operations (cut and fill). It is estimated that the accuracy of the 
              Bathymetric DEMs is 2% of depth or 1 meter for depths grater than 20 meters and 2 % of depth or 0.20 
              meters for depths shallower than 20 meters. THESE DEMs SHOULD NOT BE USED FOR NAVIGATION. There are 
              three types of DEM vertical errors: blunder, systematic, and random. These errors are reduced in 
              magnitude by editing but cannot be completely eliminated. Blunders are errors of major proportions and 
              are easily identified and removed during interactive editing. Systematic errors follow some fixed 
              pattern and are introduced by data collection procedures and systems. Systematic error artifacts include 
              vertical unsampled elevation shifts, relative spacing of the source soundings, misinterpretation of 
              terrain surface caused by softness or poor reflectivity and by the resolution of the collected soundings 
              (feet, feet &amp; fractions, fathoms, fathoms &amp; fractions, meters, tenths of meters etc.). Random errors 
              result from unknown or accidental causes. The 1 degree (DSQ) DEMs are generated from 30 m grids on UTM 
              projection. The RMSE difference between these surfaces is an estimate of the vertical accuracy of the 
              DSQ DEMs.

<b>        Completeness omission: </b>
<b>          Evaluation method description: </b>
<b></b>              The DEM is visually inspected for completeness on a DEM view and edit system for the purpose of performing 
              a final quality control and if necessary, edit of the DEM. The physical format of each DEM is validated 
              for content completeness and logical consistency during production quality control. Due to the variable 
              orientation of the 7 1/2 minute quadrilateral in relation to the Universal Transverse Mercator (UTM) 
              projection grid, profiles that pass within the bounds of the DEM quadrilateral may be void of elevation 
              grid points and are not represented in the DEM. This condition occurs infrequently and is always the 
              first or last profile of the dataset. DEM's may contain void areas caused by elevations being above Mean 
              High Water or on non-tidal land. Void elevations are assigned the value of -32,767. In addition, suspect 
              elevation areas may exist in the DEM but are not specifically identified. Only available data digitized 
              before 1997 were used in this project. Additional sounding information may exist for areas which have 
              holes in the bathymetric data set, but was not available at the time this project was completed. No 
              additional updates or error corrections are planned for this data set.

<PRE wrap="">                  				in the collection of standard National Oceanic and Atmospheric
                  				Administration (NOAA) Bathymetric Digital Elevation Models (DEM's) vary
                  				depending on systems used at the time of the survey.
                  
                  				Logsheets were kept at all stages of processing to track file names,
                  				dates, hydrographic survey coverage, and soundings or hydrographic
                  				surveys that were deleted as part of the quality control process. A
                  				short summary of the processing steps for each estuary is available on
                  				the individual data pages.  In addition, a list of each of the surveys
                  				which were included is accessible through the individual data pages.
                  
                  				Original hydrographic data from the National Ocean Service and it
                  				predecessors was used exclusively as source data.  Processing was
                  				performed on desktop computers using a variety of commercial and custom
                  				software systems.  The two main software systems used were Digital
                  				Optimization of Grid Systems (DOGS) version 1.5x software developed by
                  				NOAA and MapInfo Professional version 4.5 published by MapInfo augmented
                  				 by a MapInfo add-on named Vertical Mapper published by Northwood
                  				Geosciences.  The processing sequence for each estuary started with the
                  				generation of a comprehensive source data set from the NOS archives,
                  				These source sounding were quality controlled to eliminate outliers and
                  				superseded surveys, optimized to reduce the number of data values,
                  				augmented with points representing the Mean High Water shoreline, and
                  				then gridded.  The gridded data sets were converted from the internal
                  				proprietary grid format to Digital Elevation Model (DEM) format for
                  				public distribution.
                  
                  				Creating Point Sets of Hydrographic Survey Data:
                  				Sounding data obtained from Hydrographic Surveys were extracted using
                  				DOGS from the GEODAS CD distributed by the National Geophysical Data
                  				Center using each estuary's shoreline as a clipping boundary. Large
                  				estuaries were broken into several overlapping regions and subsets of
                  				points were extracted and processed. Most historic hydrographic surveys
                  				are included on the GEODAS CD.  For those regions which were missing
                  				data (parts of southern Florida &amp; Chesapeake Bays only), soundings
                  				were digitized from a hard copy Smooth sheets generated by the
                  				Hydrographic Surveys.
                  
                  				Editing and Quality Control of Bathymetry Point Data:
                  				The first step of the quality control was to review the data using the
                  				DOGS software.  The data were first examined for surveys or parts of
                  				surveys that are redundant. For many areas there are more surveys than
                  				are actually useful.  Entire surveys or large portions of surveys were
                  				deleted for the following reasons:
                  				- Another more recent survey fully covers the same area.
                  				- The survey has questionable values which can not be fixed by way of
                  				figuring out a mathematical update value for the entire survey, and
                  				there are too many bad points to pick out probable "good" values.
                  				- Sections of surveys were omitted if they were overlapped by more
                  				accurate surveys or by similar yet denser coverage.
                  				The second step was to display the data by depth values and to remove
                  				stray points that were obvious outliers from the surrounding data
                  				values.
                  
                  				Optimizing the Bathymetry Point Data using DOGS:
                  				The data was first triangulated in DOGS in order to optimize the set of
                  				points. The computer program DOGS can analyze a large set of bathymetric
                  				 data and create from it a smaller set of optimized points which
                  				describes the bathymetry of a geographic region to within a user defined
                  				 error.  This smaller data set then can be used on its own as a
                  				representation of the area's bathymetry, or as input into other computer
                  				 programs or Geographical Information Systems.
                  
                  				There are two calculation options for triangulation in DOGS: relative
                  				and absolute.  Bathymetry point files were cut into sections for
                  				separate processing based on mean depth of 10 meters.  A relative height
                  				 error criteria of 0.01 was used for the triangulation of regions whose
                  				depths averaged above 10 meters.  An absolute height error criteria of
                  				0.1 meters was used for areas with average depths less than 10 meters.
                  				The two resultant files were saved as text files.  After combining these
                  				 files, the vertical error associated with the optimized data set was 1%
                  				 of depth or 0.1 meters, whichever was greater.  The optimized DOG file
                  				was imported into MapInfo's MapInfo Professional desktop mapping
                  				software.
                  
                  				Augmenting the data set with  Shoreline Points:
                  				The final bathymetry was clipped to NOAA's 1:250,000 Coastal Assessment
                  				Framework (CAF) shoreline.  A copy of the shoreline file was edited to
                  				create a point file from the vector vertices and optimized using DOGS to
                  				 produce a more workable, smaller file, with little compromise to the
                  				shape of the shoreline.  Mean High Water tide level was assigned to the
                  				shoreline points to give them a height.  These Shoreline data points
                  				were added to the set of bathymetry points before doing the final
                  				triangulation in MapInfo.
                  
                  				Generation of a Gridded Bathymetry Dataset:
                  				Linear triangulation of the combined point files were done in MapInfo
                  				using the Vertical Mapper 2.0 partner product software.  The resultant
                  				TIN file was then used to create a continuous grid file with 30 meter
                  				resolution on a UTM projection  using a NAD27 horizontal datum.  A
                  				second grid was created from the first by aggregating the 30 meter grid
                  				values to 90 meter resolution and exporting the 90m center points.  A
                  				new TIN was created after reattaching the shoreline pts.  The triangle
                  				side lengths and coincident point distances were small enough to
                  				disallow interpolation outside the 90m distance, so as to emulate a
                  				rectangular interpolation and still allow the shoreline  to be
                  				represented without averaging out the values.  The result of the new
                  				file is a geographic 3 arc second resolution grid.   Both grids were cut
                  				 to the estuary boundary shoreline.  7.5 minute and 1 degree sections
                  				were then created from these grids.  The 7.5 minute grids have 30 meter
                  				resolution in a UTM  projection using the NAD27 datum.  The 1 degree
                  				grids have a 3 arc second resolution in a geographic projection
                  				(Latitude/Longitude) using the NAD27 datum.  In their native form, both
                  				of these grids are in proprietary formats.
                  
                  				Creating DEM files:
                  				The MapInfo grid files were converted to a public domain USGS format DEM
                  				 files using the NOAA DEM maker software.  The formats available for
                  				downloading are 30 meter &amp; 3 arc second DEMs in USGS DEM format.
                  				DEM's are viewed on interactive editing systems to identify and correct
                  				blunder and systematic errors.  DEM's are verified for physical format
                  				and logical consistency.
