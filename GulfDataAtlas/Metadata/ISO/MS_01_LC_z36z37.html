<b>      Abstract: </b>
<b></b>          This data set contains the 2001-era or classifications of US Gulf Coast, zones 36 and 37 and can be used to 
          analyze change. This imagery was collected as part of the Multi-Resolution Land Characteristics program in a 
          multi- agency effort to provide baseline multi-scale environmental characteristics and to monitor 
          environmental change. This data set utilized 67 full or partial Landsat 5 and 7 Thematic Mapper and Enhanced 
          Thematic Mapper scenes which were analyzed according to the Coastal Change Analysis Program (C-CAP) protocol 
          to determine land cover.
<b>      Purpose: </b>
<b></b>          To improve the understanding of coastal uplands and wetlands, and their linkages with the distribution, 
          abundance, and health of living marine resources.

<b></b>                  This dataset was created by Sanborn Mapping Company. This version of the classification is the 
                  (2001-era). The study area is the Coastal zones 36 and 37 Region. An (1995-era) classification is 
                  also available for the same area. Summary: This section outlines the classification procedure for 
                  the zones 36 and 37 C-CAP Late Date map. The three dates of imagery were first reviewed for image 
                  quality and shifts between image dates. Training points were used as the dependent variable in a 
                  CART (Classification Analysis by Regression Tree)approach. Derivative data layers (NDVI, Tasseled 
                  Cap) were calculated from the TM data and were used as additional independent variables in the 
                  analysis. There were 3 major versions of the map prior to a draft map: 1) the provisional map, 2) 
                  automated (incl. draft and final) and 3) final edited. The provisional map was developed prior to 
                  field work to give an idea of potential areas to sample. This rough map represented the first output 
                  from the CART classification routine. Ancillary data (DEMs, etc) and spectral data were used in this 
                  and all other CART models. The final automated map had additional points from the field and photo 
                  interpretation added. Points were continually added until the best possible model was developed. 
                  This represented a fully automated product. This product was then altered by hand edits to refine 
                  the classification. In addition, a percent impervious data layer developed from TM data using high 
                  resolution imagery, was imbedded into the classification to define the developed classes. This 
                  produced the final-with-edits version which is the final version of the classification and is the 
                  one described here. Pre-processing steps: Each Landsat TM scene was geo-referenced by USGS (United 
                  States Geological Survey) EROS Data Center. The Sanborn staff reviewed the spectral and spatial 
                  quality of the imagery. Areas that were greater than 1-2 pixels off were sent back to USGS for 
                  reprocessing. The data was geo-referenced to Albers Conical Equal Area, with a spheroid of GRS 1980, 
                  and Datum of NAD83. The data units is in meters. The zones 36 and 37 TM data was delivered in the 
                  form of USGS zone mosaics. The data included three dates of TM- leaf-on, leaf-off, and spring. For 
                  each date of TM, spectral and tasseled cap data were received. Field-Collected Data: The goals of 
                  the field data collection were to sample the diversity of the landscape, within the classes, and 
                  among image dates. Classes that would be more difficult to collect from air photos were targeted for 
                  field data collection. To meet these goals, Sanborn stratified the image into spectral clusters and 
                  located the field sites throughout the study area based on these. In addition to these pre-arranged 
                  sites, Sanborn collected points while driving between locations. Due to limited time and 
                  accessibility, not all polygons were assessed in the field. Those that we did not visit on the 
                  ground were labeled with digital orthophotographs or Ikonos data if it was available. Both training 
                  and validation points were collected together. See the accuracy assessment section to see how the 
                  points were split into training and validation points. Sanborn used laptop computers and GPS (Global 
                  Positioning System) to correctly locate field points on the TM imagery. Software downloaded from the 
                  Minnesota's Department of Natural Resources (DNR) was used to connect the Garmin GPS to the laptop 
                  computer and ESRI's ArcView software. Sanborn's programmer developed an ArcMap application that 
                  allowed entry of location and field notes with a click of the mouse. These data were stored in a 
                  shapefile. Items that were collected were: Land Cover characterization Special conditions and 
                  remarks Photograph Number Date/time location The data and equipment used for the fieldwork are as 
                  follows: Ancillary datasets: TIGER 2000 NLCD - mosaicked into zones State road map and Delorme state 
                  atlas www.delorme.com Hardware: with ArcView/ArcGIS and data GARMIN GPS modules and external 
                  antennae, redundant data cables Cameras devices (Floppy Drives, CD Burners, external HDD) Extra 
                  batteries (lap-top and GPS) Mobile phones System backup CD's with data and software Compass 
                  notebooks with instructions and road maps with pre-determined routes Wetland and Vegetation Field 
                  Guides Imagery: Image data for each zone Initial classifications Classification: After the field 
                  points for training were collected, they were combined with photo-interpreted points and used as the 
                  dependent variable in a CART classification approach. Many layers tested as independent layers. They 
                  included three dates of spectral and tasseled cap imagery, DEM, slope, aspect, texture, band indices 
                  (NDVI, Moisture, NDVI-Green), shape indices fractal dimension, compactness, convexity, and form), 
                  Census data (housing and population density). Statistical analyses and visual inspection of the 
                  output was used to eliminate data that was redundant or not useful in the classification. Additional 
                  training points were added to help reduce some of the confusion between classes. The rough 
                  classification was created at the end of this process using only the CART discrete decision-tree 
                  software. A provisional classification was produced by applying spatial models using ancillary data 
                  to the rough classification. The final automated map was then edited using hand editing techniques 
                  while using high resolution imagery from as reference data. Independently, of this process, NOAA 
                  produced percent impervious data layers for zones 36 and 37. This layer was developed from 
                  Regression Tree and used impervious classifications from IKONOS imagery to predict pixel level 
                  percent impervious at the TM pixel level. The continuous percent impervious data was thresholded to 
                  produce the developed categories and imbedded into the final map. Attributes for this product are as 
                  follows: 0 Background 1 Unclassified (Cloud, Shadow, etc) 2 High Intensity Developed 3 Medium

                  slope, aspect, positional index, NWI, NLCD, TIGER2000, field-collected points, photo-interpreted 
                  points, zones 36 and 37 GAP reclassified by NOAA (Gap Analysis Program),Census data (housing and 
                  population density), Ecoregions. QA/QC Process: There were several QA/QC steps involved in the 
                  creation of this product. First, there was an internal QA/QC. This was done by viewing the 
                  classification frame-by-frame along with the TM imagery, the classification, and high resolution 
                  reference imagery. NOAA staff completed a similar review and provided both general and point comments.
