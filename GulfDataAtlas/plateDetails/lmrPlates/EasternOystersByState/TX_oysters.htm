oysters, <i>Crassostrea virginica</i>, in Texas</span></b><span

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><b><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>Geographic
extent:</span></b><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>  Oysters
occur throughout the seven bay systems in Texas, with the largest reef
assemblages located in the Galveston, Matagorda, and Aransas bay systems. 
Altogether, Texas bays contain an estimated 76,000 acres of oyster reef.  
Oysters in Texas occur primarily on large subtidal reefs in moderate salinity
regions of the bays, with vertical relief ranging from approximately
0.3 to 2 m in height.   </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><b><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>Major
harvesting times and economic impact:</span></b><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>
Presently, oysters in Texas are commercially harvested from November 1 - April
30 in the Galveston, Matagorda, San Antonio and Aransas bay systems.  Commercial
landings in 2010 exceeded 5.8 million pounds, generating over $19.2 million in
revenue for the state.  Harvest from private oyster leases, located in
Galveston Bay, occurs year round and accounts for approximately one quarter of
the annual production and ex-vessel value.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><b><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>Problems:</span></b><span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>  Oyster populations in Texas have
experienced habitat loss due to historical shell dredging, overharvest, storm
impacts, and disease.  In 1963, the marketable oyster size was reduced from 3.5
inches to 3.0 inches because oysters &gt; 3.0 inches were succumbing to disease
(<i>Perkinsus marinus</i>) before they were allowed to be harvested.  In 2005, due
to concerns about overharvesting, a moratorium was placed on commercial oyster
licenses.  However, in the final days before the bill was passed, there was a
rush to purchase licenses, resulting in an additional 400 licenses being added
to the fishery, most of which remain today.  In 2008, as a result of sediment
deposition from Hurricane Ike, the Galveston Bay system lost approximately 50%,
or 8,000 acres of oysters.  Most of these losses were due to sedimentation,
leading to severe oyster mortalities and submerging available hard substrate, impeding
larval oyster settlement and natural recovery processes.  Reduction of
freshwater inflow to Texas bays is an ongoing issue, as the combination of high
salinities and temperatures leads to oyster mortalities through increased
disease and predation.  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><b><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>Recovery
and restoration:</span></b><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>
 Oyster restoration efforts have been ongoing in Texas since the late 1940s
when records indicate both oyster shells and live oysters were used for reef
building.  The majority of restoration projects in Texas have been constructed
during the past 20 years, using primarily reclaimed shells, rock, or crushed
concrete to provide hard substrates for attachment by young oysters.  Presently,
oyster reef restoration projects are ongoing in the Galveston, Matagorda and
Aransas Bay systems by federal, state, and NGO groups, including Texas Parks
and Wildlife Department, Texas A&amp;M University-Corpus Christi, and The
Nature Conservancy.  The goal of these projects is to reverse declines in
oyster populations due to overharvest, loss of substrate, and shoreline
erosion.  </span></p>
