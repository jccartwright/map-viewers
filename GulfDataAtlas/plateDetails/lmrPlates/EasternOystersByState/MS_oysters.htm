<p class=MsoNormal><b>Shellfish Program in Mississippi</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The Shellfish Bureau of DMR is responsible for the
management of Mississippi’s marine shellfish resources with two primary
functions:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>•           Manage and enhance the resource.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>•           Maintain compliance with the Interstate
Shellfish Sanitation Conference’s National Shellfish Sanitation Program
(ISSC/NSSP) Model Ordinance requirements for shellfish-growing waters.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Oysters, as sessile filter feeders, are subject to the
influence of environmental conditions to a greater extent than motile species.
Consequently, oyster landings can change dramatically from year to year
according to those conditions. In addition to fluctuations in the amount of
rainfall, problems with upland discharge can render oyster-growing areas closed
to harvest. During the oyster season and throughout the year, field sampling
trips are made to stations strategically located throughout the oyster reef
areas to collect water samples that are analyzed for fecal coliform content.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Opening and closing of reef areas is based primarily on the
levels of fecal coliform in the water column at the time of sampling. Oyster
reefs in certain areas must be closed after significant rainfall or river stage
events until it can be determined that the water quality has improved sufficiently
to allow harvesting to resume. To accomplish this, multiple stations are
sampled in each reef area or sub-area. Samples must be obtained from each area
and analyzed before an area can be reopened for harvest following a closure.
Water quality samples are also obtained throughout the year to properly
classify shellfish-growing waters.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The Shellfish Sanitation Program is one of the agency’s most
labor-intensive efforts, requiring almost daily routine water-quality sampling
and laboratory analysis of samples for fecal coliform bacteria. The data is
used to properly classify oyster-growing waters in accordance with NSSP
guidelines and to provide necessary justification for reopening oyster reefs
following rainfall and/or river discharge events that degrade water quality to
levels requiring that reefs be closed to protect the health of the consumers. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>For areas to be classified as “Approved,” the geometric mean
fecal coliform level most probable number (MPN) cannot exceed 14, and not more
than 10 percent of the samples taken can exceed an MPN of 43. Additionally,
U.S. Food and Drug Administration requirements also specify minimum sampling
frequencies at each of the 176 sampling stations in the Mississippi Sound.
Approved areas are those in which water quality does not degrade after any
rainfall and/or corresponding river discharge. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Areas classified as “Conditionally Approved” are subject to
frequent openings and closures due to rainfall or river stage. Along with
monitoring the water quality of the oyster reefs, other work performed on the
reefs involves revitalization efforts such as reef cultivation, oyster relaying,
and the planting of cultch material.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Status: </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>•            The 2008-2009 commercial oyster season began
Sept. 25, 2008, and ended March 17, 2009. A total of 16,444 boat trips
harvested 385,946 sacks of oysters.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>•           Spring 2009 Cultch Plant — In April through May
2009, 14,330 cubic yards of limestone and 21,003 cubic yards of oyster shells
were spread over 575 acres on Pass Christian, Henderson Point, Pass Marianne
and St. Joes Reefs.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>•           Fall 2008 Cultch Plant – In August through
September 2008 24,444 cubic yards of limestone and 24,196 cubic yards of oyster
shells were planted over 1600 acres on the Pass Christian, Pass Marianne,
Henderson Point and St. Joes reefs.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Planned:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>•           Oyster Stewardship Program — The Shellfish
Bureau will schedule additional Oyster Stewardship Program Meetings to continue
to develop and implement an oyster stewardship program to better inform and
promote the active involvement of oyster harvesters and the industry in harvest
practices and other techniques that can be used to assist resource managers in
the judicious utilization of oyster resources of the state. Harvesters and
industry representatives will be heavily involved throughout the development
and implementation process through meetings, surveys and individual contacts.
Innovative methods of improving the resource potential will be investigated and
implemented when feasible.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>•           Oyster reef cultivation with Conservationist —
By towing large dredges with the bags removed over the reefs, existing shell
material covered by sedimentation or debris is re-exposed to the setting of
oyster larvae. This process also breaks up clusters of hooked mussels which
have encrusted the oysters, allowing oysters additional space to feed and grow</p>
