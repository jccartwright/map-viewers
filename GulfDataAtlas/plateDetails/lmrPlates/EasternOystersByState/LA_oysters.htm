<p style='background:white'><b>Eastern oysters, <i>Crassostrea virginica</i>,
in Louisiana</b></p>

<p style='background:white'><b>Range</b>:  The estuarine environment in
Louisiana spans along the coast from Mississippi Sound in St. Bernard Parish to
the eastside of Sabine Pass in Cameron Parish, and is home to Louisiana’s most
important mollusc species from both an economic and ecological standpoint, the American
(=Eastern) oyster (<i>Crassostrea virginica</i>). </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><b><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>Harvest Season</span></b><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>: The oyster
harvest season for public oyster areas generally runs from September through
April of the following year. Private oyster leases may be fished at any time
provided the Louisiana Department of Health and Hospitals (LDHH) has classified
the waters as open for harvest.   The LDHH may close certain areas based on
water quality to protect public health.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><b><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>Management</span></b><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>: The Louisiana
Department of Wildlife and Fisheries (LDWF) is responsible for oyster
management on nearly 1.7 million acres of public oyster areas and also leases an
additional 390,000 acres of state owned water bottoms to private entities for
oyster cultivation.  For the public areas, oyster management involves the
enforcement of size and possession limits, seasonal framework, and gear
(dredges, tongs, and scrapers) restrictions. The planting of suitable hard
substrate (cultch) on water bottoms is also a major component of oyster
management on public oyster areas, along with extensive biological sampling.  Providing
clean, hard settlement substrata for oyster larvae helps rehabilitate oyster
reefs which have been degraded due to natural forces (i.e. hurricanes) and
commercial harvest.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><b><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>Economic</span></b><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>: Louisiana traditionally
produced approximately one-third of all oysters harvested in the U.S. and 50
percent of oysters harvested in the Gulf of Mexico.  Louisiana landed 14.7
million pounds of oysters with a dockside value of $49.9 million in 2009 (NMFS). 
Previous economic assessments have valued this harvest at over $300 million in
total economic impact to Louisiana.  Unfortunately, the annual harvest dropped
to under 7 million pounds in 2010 for only the third time since 1950.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><b><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>Recent Projects</span></b><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>: Since 2007,
eight reef rehabilitation projects have been constructed covering nearly 1,000
acres at a cost of approximately $9.7 million.  Additionally, LDWF conducted an
oyster mortality investigation during the spring and summer of 2010 in response
to an influx of low salinity waters into the estuaries of Breton Sound and
Barataria Bay. For more information navigate to </span><a

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>Currently, LDWF and Louisiana State
University have begun a cooperative project to release oyster larvae and spat
in the Hackberry Public Oyster Seed Reservation as part of oyster
rehabilitation efforts. For more information navigate to </span><a

style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>.  Additionally,
LDWF performs an annual oyster stock assessment on the public areas each
summer.  Previous years’ stock assessments can be accessed on the LDWF website

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><b><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>Problems Encountered by the Fishery</span></b><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>:  Since 2005,
the Louisiana oyster fishery has been impacted by four major hurricanes
(Katrina, Rita, Gustav, and Ike), four freshet events (2008-2011), and the
largest oil spill in U.S. history (2010).  These events severely impacted both
the oyster resource and the oyster industry.  Biological sampling has
documented extensive oyster mortalities and incidents of failures in reproductive
events, leading to significant reductions in oyster abundance on many reefs. </span></p>
