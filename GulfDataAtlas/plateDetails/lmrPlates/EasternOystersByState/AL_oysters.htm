<p class=MsoNormal><b><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>Eastern
oysters, <i>Crassostrea virginica</i>, in Alabama</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><b><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>Geographic
extent: </span></b><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>Oysters
are found throughout coastal waters of Alabama; however, significant
concentrations of oysters, oyster reefs, are located in Mobile Bay and Mississippi Sound.   Over 3,000 acres of oyster reefs occur in Alabama.  Oyster reefs
in Alabama are subtidal, low relief structures usually less than 2 feet in
height. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><b><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>Major
harvesting times and economic impact:</span></b><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>
 Oysters are primarily harvested with tongs, although use of a dredge is
permitted in certain areas.   For nearly five years drought conditions have
persisted in Alabama which has negatively impacted the amount of oysters
available for harvest.  In 2006, the last year before the drought began, over
12 million pounds of oysters were harvested in Alabama which had a dockside
value of $3.6 million.   In 2010, a new oyster harvesting bill was passed in
the Alabama legislature which, in part, allows the Commissioner of the
Department of Conservation and Natural Resources (DCNR) to establish a closed
commercial season.   Prior to 2011, oyster reefs were open to harvest
year-round except when the Department of Public Health closed reefs due to
temporary conditions which affect public health.  Currently, the closed season
is from May 1 – September 30.  Privately leased water bottoms are used to raise
oysters.  Harvest of oysters from private leases is open year round except
during closures by the Department of Public Health yet landings from these
areas is less than 10% of the total oyster landings under normal conditions. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><b><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>Problems:</span></b><span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>  Oyster populations are under
constant threat of sedimentation or damage due to tropical storms.  Hurricanes
Ivan and Katrina in 2004 and 2005, respectively, levied considerable damage.   
In the last five years, the Southeastern United States has been under
persistent drought conditions.  These conditions have lead to increased
salinities in lower Mobile Bay and much of Mississippi Sound.  These conditions
were ideal for predatory oyster drills resulting in some oyster reef
populations to decline 90% over the period.  In addition to reduced freshwater
inputs into Mobile Bay due to the drought, upstream water use for industrial,
agricultural and human needs have increased dramatically over the last 10
years.  This has exacerbated the problem of inadequate freshwater inputs.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><b><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>Recovery
and restoration:</span></b><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>
 For decades DCNR has enhanced oyster reefs with various cultch material
including oyster shell, crushed limestone and relict freshwater clam shell. 
These plantings usually occurred after hurricanes to mitigate for losses
incurred from specific events.  Over the last three years, DCNR has relocated
over 150 acres of oysters and planted over 300 acres of cultch.  Recently
passed legislation will assist the Department of Conservation and Natural
Resources with improved assessment and management of existing oyster reefs. 
This will be accomplished through more precise and timely reporting of
harvested oysters, increased monitoring and sampling of oyster populations, and
more frequent cultch plantings.   In the last 5-7 years, various
nongovernmental organizations have become more involved with oyster restoration
projects.  To date these projects utilize oyster shell in conjunction with
living shoreline designs.</span></p>
