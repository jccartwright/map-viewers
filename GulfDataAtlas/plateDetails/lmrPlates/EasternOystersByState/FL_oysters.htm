<p class=MsoNormal><b>Eastern oysters, <i>Crassostrea virginica</i>, in Florida</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Oysters (<i>Crassostrea virginica</i>) are common in Florida estuaries where the mixing of freshwater and marine waters provide a favorable
environment for productive oyster populations.  An essential characteristic of
adult oysters is their ability to tolerate and thrive under wide ranges of
environmental conditions, and to colonize in waters where there are favorable
salinity regimes, available nutrition, and suitable substrate.  Oysters
typically aggregate in clusters that over generations establish oyster reefs
that are discrete structures that form distinguishable features in estuaries
and coastal waters that may support viable oyster communities for decades and
even hundreds of years.  The distribution and abundance of oyster populations
has been described for numerous historically productive estuaries in Florida, including Suwannee Sound, Matanzas River and the Indian River, with the most
abundant and productive oyster reefs occurring in Apalachicola Bay.  However, declines in oyster reefs have been exacerbated in recent years by continued
coastal development and alteration of coastal freshwater drainage patterns that
have strongly influenced the abundance and distribution of productive oyster
reef habitat.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>Oyster fisheries management in Florida dates back to the
beginning of the 19th century. In 1913, the Florida Shellfish Commission was
organized and shellfish harvesting laws were enacted; in 1933 the Florida Board
of Conservation was established and assumed control of statewide shellfish
management.  Since that time, various agencies [including the Florida
Department of Natural Resources, the Department of Environmental Protection,
the Marine Fisheries Commission, the Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission,
and the Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services] have been responsible
for managing oyster resources and fisheries.  Fisheries-directed management
practices have included establishing harvesting seasons, size limits, bag
limits, and gear restrictions, while resource-directed management practices create
and restore reef substrate.  Public management practices date back nearly a
century, and the state has been involved in comprehensive oyster resource
management since 1949.  Public reefs account for 90-95% of the oysters landed
in Florida, so management has focused on sustaining public reefs.  Enhancing
substrate by replacing cultch material (hard substrate suitable for attachment
of settling oysters) has long been accepted as a beneficial management
practice, and gives resource managers the opportunity to mitigate resource
losses, increase production and contribute direct economic benefit to
fisheries-dependent communities.  In 2009 the dockside value of reported oyster
landings exceeded $7 million with an economic value greater than 5 times the
dockside value.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>&nbsp;</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Recently, oysters have been recognized as a keystone species
within Florida’s estuaries, and productive oyster reef habitat as been
identified as an essential component in sustaining estuarine ecosystems.  Beyond
the fact that oysters and oyster reef communities represent important food
sources for many species of commercially important fish and invertebrates,
functioning oyster reefs are also recognized as critical structural and
community components which stabilize and sustain a broad array of ecological
relationships.  Sustainable reefs form the foundation for oysters, as an
engineering species, to contribute to wide reaching fishery and ecological
benefits.  Ecological benefits are realized through an array of ecological
services in the form of increased fishery and wildlife habitat; increased
biodiversity and trophic dynamics; increased filtering capacity to improve
water quality and recycle nutrients; and increased structural stability to
reduce coastal erosion and to protect near shore resources.  Economic benefits
are also realized through harvesting, processing, and marketing fishery
products and felt locally and regionally by all who enjoy high-quality,
wholesome Florida seafood; depend upon commercial fisheries for employment and
income; and recreate in Florida’s waters.  Because of this ecological complexity,
functioning oyster communities are essential to prudent resource management.</p>
