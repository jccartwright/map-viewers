        <p/>
        Coastal ecosystems, such as estuaries, bays, and lagoons, act as a buffer between the land and the sea. Healthy estuaries and bays receive significant amounts of nutrients and organic matter through rivers and streams. These resources enable the estuaries to support productive communities of marshes, algae, and submerged aquatic vegetation, which provide food and shelter for a wide variety of animals, which range from shellfish, crabs, and snails to shorebirds, finfish, and turtles, and in some regions, even to manatees.
        <p/>
        During the last century, many coastal regions have experienced dramatic changes. The world's human population has increased by an order of magnitude, and a large part of that population lives near the coast. Many estuaries are now impaired by excessive nutrients from sewage and agriculture; coastal wetlands have been transformed into developed land; and submerged aquatic vegetation, such as seagrass beds, are disappearing at an alarming rate. In the United States, as in many other developed countries, these changes have raised public awareness and resulted in efforts to protect our coasts. Nevertheless, coastal ecosystems remain at risk, especially in regions with rapidly increasing populations, such as the Florida panhandle.
        <p/>
        Long-term monitoring allows for the accurate assessment of the impacts that human development has on the health of coastal ecosystems. With long-term monitoring, early signs of otherwise irreparable damage can be discerned and the appropriate measures taken to avert further degradation. Long-term monitoring programs are most powerful when applied to systems subject to varying degrees of degradation. Such efforts allow us to clarify how widespread, chronic, anthropogenic environmental perturbations (e.g., climate change) interact with system-specific alterations (such as land transformation in the local watershed) to affect the health, integrity, and sustainability of coastal ecosystems.
        <p/>
        A long-term monitoring project has been ongoing since 2000 in three shallow coastal lagoons near Perdido Bay, Florida: State Park, Kee's Bayou, and Gongora. These lagoons connect to the same body of water and have similar hydrographic characteristics (e.g., depth, temperature, and salinity), but are subject to differing levels of human development.
        <p/>
        <img src="images/incident_green.png" height="20" width="20"><b>State Park</b> (30.308&deg N, 87.403&deg W) is located in Big Lagoon State Park, and is entirely surrounded by salt marsh and maritime forest with no residential development. Shoalgrass (<i>Halodule wrightii</i>), along with some widgeon grass (<i>Ruppia maritima</i>) and turtle grass (<i>Thalassia testudinum</i>), covers about 60% of the lagoon's bottom. (<a href="javascript:getAnimation('/website/DataAtlas/products/bioticPlates/PerdidoCoastalLagoons/SAV_SP.gif')"><font color="blue"><u>click here to see time series</u></font></a>). State Park has a surface area of 22,659 m<sup>2</sup> and the average depth is 0.40 m. It is connected downstream to Big Lagoon Sound through a channel that crosses a sandbar and then moves upstream to a brackish lake through a meandering, narrow channel. Along the channel, pulses of high dissolved organic matter (DOM) are discharged into the lagoon after intense rainfall.
        <p/>
        <img src="images/incident_blue.png" height="20" width="20"><b>Kee's Bayou</b> (30.310&deg N, 87.469&deg W) features a higher degree of human development in comparison with State Park. This lagoon is surrounded with houses on the eastern side and a road on the northern side (e.g., suburban land use), but the southern and western sides are bordered with salt marsh. Kee's Bayou has a surface area of 30,208 m<sup>2</sup>, an average depth of 0.47 m, and is connected to Big Lagoon Sound through a narrow channel. Mixed patches of shoal grass and widgeon grass occur in the lagoon. The percent bottom area covered by these grasses in the lagoon has increased considerably over the past few years, although it has remained at lower levels than the steady cover found at State Park (<a href="javascript:getAnimation('/website/DataAtlas/products/bioticPlates/PerdidoCoastalLagoons/SAV_KB.gif')"><font color="blue"><u>click here to see time series</u></font></a>). The sediment in Kee's Bayou is finer than in State Park and, thus, is easily stirred up. In addition, the lagoon has been dredged a few times over the monitoring period.
        <p/>
        <img src="images/incident_red.png" height="20" width="20"><b>Gongora</b> (30.305&deg N, 87.424&deg W) represents the site with the highest level of human development. This narrow lagoon (<a href="javascript:getAnimation('/website/DataAtlas/products/bioticPlates/PerdidoCoastalLagoons/2004_GC.png')"><font color="blue"><u>click here to see image of lagoon</u></font></a>) is bordered by houses on the northern and eastern sides (e.g., urban land use) and by a road on the western side. A culvert underneath the road connects the lagoon to an 18-hole golf course (e. g., urban land use). The southern side is bordered with salt marsh. The lagoon has a surface area of 9,841 m<sup>2</sup>, an average depth of 0.48 m, and is connected to Big Lagoon Sound. No seagrass has occurred at Gongora since the monitoring program began. The sediment ranges from sandy (at the mouth) to muddy (at the upstream end). The lagoon is periodically dredged, and over the years, the entire northern and eastern shoreline has been bulkheaded.
        <p/>
        The long-term monitoring program, coupled with targeted laboratory and field experiments, are generating a detailed picture of how the varying intensity of human development affects the environmental well-being of the lagoons. Reduced levels of water clarity were found in the developed lagoons in relation to the pristine lagoon because of dredging and nutrient-fuelled algal growth. In turn, reduced water clarity imposes severe restrictions on seagrass growth, which is probably the reason for the reduced seagrass cover in Kee's Bayou and its total absence in Gongora (<a href="javascript:openGraphicPortrait('/website/DataAtlas/Acknowledgements.htm#Character')"><font color="blue"><u>Stutes et al., 2007</u></font></a>; <a href="javascript:openGraphicPortrait('/website/DataAtlas/Acknowledgements.htm#Character')"><font color="blue"><u>Cebrian et al., 2009a</u></font></a>; and <a href="javascript:openGraphicPortrait('/website/DataAtlas/Acknowledgements.htm#Character')"><font color="blue"><u>Lehrter and Cebrian, 2010</u></font></a>).
        <p/>
        The ecosystem impacts of this human-driven reduction of seagrass cover are being documented. As seagrass abundance declines, the developed lagoons have a much lower abundance of finfish (<a href="javascript:openGraphicPortrait('/website/DataAtlas/Acknowledgements.htm#Character')"><font color="blue"><u>Cebrian et al., 2009b</u></font></a>), many of which have commercial and/or recreational interest; depressed levels of primary productivity (<a href="javascript:openGraphicPortrait('/website/DataAtlas/Acknowledgements.htm#Character')"><font color="blue"><u>Stutes et al., 2007</u></font></a>); and less diverse communities of benthic invertebrates dominated by species that thrive in eutrophic sediments (<a href="javascript:openGraphicPortrait('/website/DataAtlas/Acknowledgements.htm#Character')"><font color="blue"><u>Ferrero-Vicente et al., 2011</u></font></a>). The long-term database will also allow exploration of the interactions among these stressors generated by human development and other chronic, wide-spread human perturbations, such as climate change.
