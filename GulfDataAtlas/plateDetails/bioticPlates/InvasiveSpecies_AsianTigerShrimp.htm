        Asian tiger shrimp (<i>Penaeus monodon</i>), also known as giant tiger prawn, are native to the coastal waters of Australia, South East Asia, South Asia, and East Africa (<a href="javascript:openGraphicPortrait('/website/DataAtlas/Acknowledgements.htm#TigerShrimp')"><font color="blue"><u>FAO, 2005-2013</u></font></a>). Tiger shrimp have a variety of markings and colors. The typical form has light and dark tiger-like stripes. However some individuals, especially at larger size, become uniformly dark. They can be identified by the yellow and/or blue markings at the base of the swimming legs. Another form that was specifically bred for in aquaculture had a dark red stripe down the back. In some areas, this stripe is now displaying as gray instead of red. Sometimes they can be identified by their large size alone as they get much larger than our native species, reaching up to 33 cm in length (<a href="javascript:openGraphicPortrait('/website/DataAtlas/Acknowledgements.htm#TigerShrimp')"><font color="blue"><u>FAO, 2005-2013</u></font></a>). Larval, juvenile, adolescent and sub-adult stages occur in estuarine, lagoonal and shallow coastal areas while adults are found offshore in water depths up to 110 meters (<a href="javascript:openGraphicPortrait('/website/DataAtlas/Acknowledgements.htm#TigerShrimp')"><font color="blue"><u>Knott et al., 2013</u></font></a>). As burrowers, they prefer sandy to muddy bottom habitats and emerge at night to feed and to spawn (<a href="javascript:openGraphicPortrait('/website/DataAtlas/Acknowledgements.htm#TigerShrimp')"><font color="blue"><u>FAO, 2005-2013</u></font></a>). They are mainly predators of small crustaceans, including those of their own species (<a href="javascript:openGraphicPortrait('/website/DataAtlas/Acknowledgements.htm#TigerShrimp')"><font Color="blue"><u>Knott et al., 2013</u></font></a>). Tiger shrimp have been intensively farmed in many Asian countries since the 1980s when advances in feed formulas were achieved. They are a high-value product in great demand internationally in a very lucrative industry, despite cultured stocks' susceptibility to viral disease outbreaks (<a href="javascript:openGraphicPortrait('/website/DataAtlas/Acknowledgements.htm#TigerShrimp')"><font color="blue"><u>FAO, 2005-2013</u></font></a>).  
        <p/>
        In the United States, Asian tiger shrimp were first found off the coast of South Carolina, Georgia and Florida in 1988 following escape from a farm. They were not seen again until one appeared in the Gulf of Mexico in the Mississippi Sound near Dauphin Island in 2006. A single specimen was found in 2007 in Vermillion Bay, Louisiana. They were later found off the coast of Mississippi in 2009 and Texas in 2011, (<a href="javascript:openGraphicPortrait('/website/DataAtlas/Acknowledgements.htm#TigerShrimp')"><font color="blue"><u>Knott et al., 2013</u></font></a>). (see <a href="javascript:getExternalLink('http://nas.er.usgs.gov//queries/SpeciesAnimatedMap.aspx?speciesID=1209')"><font color="blue"><u>animated time-series map</u></font></a> of the USGS-NAS data points). Most of the specimens reported in the Gulf to date have been along the Louisiana coast to the Florida panhandle and are thought to have migrated from either wild populations or aquaculture escapes in the Caribbean via ocean currents (<a href="javascript:openGraphicPortrait('/website/DataAtlas/Acknowledgements.htm#TigerShrimp')"><font color="blue"><u>Knott et al., 2013</u></font></a>). Genetic analysis of Asian tiger shrimp samples performed by researchers from the USGS have verified that the population is established and will help determine the origins of the populations found here. Their eventual impact on Gulf of Mexico ecosystems is unknown, but the primary concerns are that they will out-compete native species for food and habitat as well as deplete stocks of their prey species, many of which are commercially important. They may also be able to transmit diseases to native shrimp and other crustaceans (<a href="javascript:openGraphicPortrait('/website/DataAtlas/Acknowledgements.htm#TigerShrimp')"><font color="blue"><u>Knott et al., 2013</u></font></a>).

        This map shows the locations of Asian tiger shrimp sightings in the Gulf of Mexico only, a subset of the larger United States Geological Survey Nonindigenous Aquatic Species<a href="javascript:getExternalLink('http://nas.er.usgs.gov//queries/collectioninfo.aspx?SpeciesID=1209')"><font color="blue"><u>(USGS-NAS)</u></font></a> Database Asian tiger shrimp collection. Different colors represent the dates of the observations, and each point may represent one to several individuals. (see the <a href="javascript:getExternalLink('http://nas2.er.usgs.gov/viewer/omap.aspx?SpeciesID=1209')"><font color="blue"><u>USGS-NAS database Asian tiger shrimp map viewer</u></font></a> for a map of the complete database). These data are a collection of reported observations, not the results of a coordinated survey program and as such, show only species occurrence, not abundance. Asian tiger shrimp sightings can be reported to the USGS-NAS via an <a href="javascript:getExternalLink('http://nas.er.usgs.gov/SightingReport.aspx')"><font color="blue"><u>online form</u></font></a>. The metadata record for the USGS-NAS database contains additional details for review and QA/QC procedures.
