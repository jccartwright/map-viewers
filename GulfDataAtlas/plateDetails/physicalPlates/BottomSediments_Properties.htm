        <center><b>General Regional Description</b></center>
        <p/>
        A strong division in the Gulf of Mexico for continental shelf areas exists between sandy environments in the east (Mississippi, Alabama, Florida) and muddy environments in the west (Louisiana, Texas). This division reflects the input and overall westward movement on the shelf of muds from the Mississippi River delta. However, even in the muddy regions, sand shoals (including barrier islands) form where wave/current interactions sort and build up mobile sands. Shell accumulations of gravel texture are often associated with the shoals. Close inshore in turbid and brackish waters, oyster beds and reef buildups are widespread.
        <p/>
        On the eastern, very sandy Gulf shelf, sorted sands and gravels with important biogenic fractions dominate over wide areas and show irregular geographic patchiness. The variability is partly due to sand waves (seabed dunes). In the region of the Florida Keys, many existing and drowned coral-algal reef and bank structures are present. Some areas sheltered by the Keys accumulate muddy sediments, such as in Florida Bay.
        <p/>
        The deeper parts of the Gulf seabed (>200 m) are comprised mostly of mud sediments, but sands are occasionally detected in the sparse samplings of these depths. These sands are thought to be from gravity slumps and flows of materials from the shelf edges caused by sea-level changes of the past, including the Mississippi River Delta. Suspendates and bottom flows of mud from the active delta appear to spread widely before finally settling over the slopes and basin floor.
        <p/>
        Some upper-slope regions have notably extensive areas of hard substrate. Many interconnected processes have formed these features: drowning of ancient coral reefs and deltas, growth of deep cold coral (<i>Lophelia</i>) banks, and formation of carbonate crusts from the alteration of gas hydrates.

        <center><b>Folk Texture Codes</b></center>
        <p/>
        Multitudes of seabed bottom samples and photos have been taken over the decades during expeditions and surveys for geology, biology, safe navigation, naval preparedness, subsea engineering and resource exploration. The navigation accuracies of the time ranged from kilometers to meters, but the data can still be integrated. Many of the samples were closely analyzed in laboratories for grain-size fraction percentages. This data collection work was done by a host of agencies, institutes, private industries, and individuals who also placed their data in the public domain or donated it to the database. The aggregated data were assembled and integrated at University of Colorado Boulder and mathematically formed into a map.
        <p/>
        This map provides an overview of the loose sediment types in the Gulf and is a guide to their mobility under waves and currents, as well as to the physical factors for benthic animals. Sediment can be classified in a variety of ways.
        <p/>
        One method, known as the <a href="javascript:createSubPlate('Bottom Sediments - Loose')"><font color="red"><u>Folk Codes</u></font></a><sup>1</sup> (<a href="javascript:openGraphicPortrait('/website/DataAtlas/Acknowledgements.htm#Sediments')"><font color="blue"><u>Folk, 1974</u></font></a>) divides sediments into mud, gravel and sand, depending on how big the particles are. Sand, coarse mud (silt), and fluid muds are unstable in areas affected by waves and currents. Gravel and stiff mud are unstable only in extreme weather conditions. Muddy bottom areas on slopes of 2&deg; or more are prone to sliding and mass failure caused by gravity and internal sediment pore-water pressures.
        <p/>
        <a href="javascript:createSubPlate('Bottom Sediments - Mud')"><font color="red"><u>Seabed Mud Content</u></font></a>: Mud is the sediment-size fraction finer than 63 &#181;m, with abundance expressed as percentage by weight. Computing separate maps for silt (coarse mud) and clay (mud finer than 2 &#181;m) contents is not possible because their routine measurement is unreliable. Nevertheless, clay content is a strong determinant of how cohesive (sticky) the bottom is.
        <p/>
        <a href="javascript:createSubPlate('Bottom Sediments - Sand')"><font color="red"><u>Seabed Sand Content</u></font></a>: Sand is the sediment-size fraction coarser than 63 &#181;m but finer than 2 mm. The sand percentages are by weight.
        <p/>
        <a href="javascript:createSubPlate('Bottom Sediments - Gravel')"><font color="red"><u>Seabed Gravel Content</u></font></a>: Gravel is the sediment-size fraction coarser than 2 mm. At the coarser end gravel includes cobbles and boulders. In this database, objects larger than 256 mm are regarded as rock, beyond gravel. The gravel percentages are by weight.
        <p/>
        <a href="javascript:createSubPlate('Bottom Sediments - Rock')"><font color="red"><u>Seabed Rock Content</u></font></a>: Rock occurs as crusts and pavements, pinnacles, and bedrock outcrops. Areas of hard biological framework, such as coral-algal reef fronts, can also be classified as rock. Rock is difficult to map by direct sampling or even visual observations, so results from geophysical techniques, such as sidescan sonar, sonar acoustic classification, and seismic wave analysis, were included in the mapping. Rock percent is in terms of estimated areal exposure, thus allowing for sediment veneers that may be present.
        <p/>
        <sup>1</sup><font size="1">Folk Codes apply to the loose sediments of the seabed. The format is explained in this example: <i>(g)sM</i>, where <i>(g)</i> is for slightly gravelly, <i>s</i> for sandy, and <i>M</i> for mud as primary fraction.
