        These maps present 5-year seasonal means, as estimated from satellite imagery, of euphotic depth in the northern Gulf of Mexico for <a href="javascript:createSubPlate('CMECS - Euphotic Depth - Fall')"><font color="red"><u>fall</u></font></a>, <a href="javascript:createSubPlate('CMECS - Euphotic Depth - Winter')"><font color="red"><u>winter</u></font></a>, <a href="javascript:createSubPlate('CMECS - Euphotic Depth - Spring')"><font color="red"><u>spring</u></font></a>, and <a href="javascript:createSubPlate('CMECS - Euphotic Depth - Summer')"><font color="red"><u>summer</u></font></a><sup>1</sup>. The euphotic (<i>Greek for "well lit"</i>) zone is the part of the upper ocean water column where there is sufficient sunlight for photosynthesis to occur and thus, an ecologically essential part of the food web. The euphotic depth represents the bottom (depth from the surface) of this important biological zone. Specifically, it is the depth at which photosynthetically available radiation (PAR) drops to 1% of its surface value. It is derived from the inherent optical properties of the water&mdash;the absorption and backscattering coefficients. Thus, it depends on the amounts of both dissolved and particulate matter contained in the water, and these vary spatially and temporally. For this product, the depth of the euphotic zone was calculated from ocean color imagery using satellite algorithms. (<a href="javascript:openGraphicPortrait('/website/DataAtlas/Acknowledgements.htm#Photic')"><font color="blue"><u>Lee et al., 2007</u></font></a>).
        <p/>
        The Naval Research Laboratory at the Stennis Space Center (NRL/SSC) processed MODIS-Aqua satellite imagery covering the Gulf of Mexico, for a 5-year time period from January 2005 to December 2009. Daily, level-1B image files were processed through the NRL/SSC Automated Processing System (APS). Six regions were processed at 1-km spatial resolution:  western Gulf of Mexico, central Gulf of Mexico, eastern Gulf of Mexico, Mobile Bay, Tampa Bay, and Galveston Bay. Monthly composite images were generated from the daily scenes to reduce the effects of cloud cover. 
        <p/>
        To calculate euphotic depth (Z<sub>eu</sub>) from the satellite imagery, the absorption and backscattering coefficients of the water were estimated from the satellite remote sensing reflectance (Rrs) values (<a href="javascript:openGraphicPortrait('/website/DataAtlas/Acknowledgements.htm#Photic')"><font color="blue"><u>Lee et al. 2002</u></font></a>); these were then used to estimate Z<sub>eu</sub> and make image products. The diffuse attenuation coefficient was calculated two ways:  at 490 nm using the NASA empirical KD2 algorithm and at 488 nm using the semianalytical algorithm of <a href="javascript:openGraphicPortrait('/website/DataAtlas/Acknowledgements.htm#Photic')"><font color="blue"><u>Lee et al. (2005a)</u></font></a>. The Lee et al. (2005a) algorithm is accurate to about 15%, compared to in situ measurements (<a href="javascript:openGraphicPortrait('/website/DataAtlas/Acknowledgements.htm#Photic')"><font color="blue"><u>Lee et al., 2005b</u></font></a>).
        <p/>
        The maps were produced as part of a NASA-funded project to evaluate the classifiers and modifiers identified in the <a href="javascript:getExternalLink('https://iocm.noaa.gov/cmecs/index.html')"><font color="blue"><u>Coastal and Marine Ecological Classification Standard (CMECS) Water Column Component</u></font></a>. The CMECS is a catalog of terms that provides a means for classifying ecological units using a simple standard format and common terminology. CMECS offers a way to organize and interpret data about the marine environment, and it provides a common platform for interrelating data. It builds upon approaches from published national, regional, and local habitat classification procedures, and it offers an umbrella under which a national coastal and marine ecological classification can grow and evolve. The project was modeled after an exercise undertaken in the United Kingdom to characterize pelagic habitats in which sea surface temperature and salinity, as well as frontal probability, were used to delineate unique pelagic zones (<a href="javascript:openGraphicPortrait('/website/DataAtlas/Acknowledgements.htm#Photic')"><font color="blue"><u>Connor et al., 2006</u></font></a>).

        To validate the satellite-derived data, comparative maps were developed in which in situ data from the Southeast Area Monitoring and Assessment Program (SEAMAP) program were overlaid on the modeled data and displayed in ArcMap 10<sup>TM</sup>. SEAMAP is a state/federal/university program for the collection, management, and dissemination of fishery-independent data and information in the southeastern United States. Both the satellite data and the SEAMAP data were then reclassified into CMECS categories. Visually, the satellite-derived products matched well with the SEAMAP in situ data. Statistical analyses of the raw data (i.e., data before reclassification into CMECS categories) indicate that the satellite-derived data are consistently different from the in situ data. Reclassifying the data into CMECS categories improved the percent accuracy of these products when compared to in situ data.

        Photic quality is a highly variable parameter. In many cases, water is clear, and downwelling light penetration extends the euphotic zone to the bottom of the water column. In cases of reduced water clarity, light is highly attenuated. Photic exposure depends on the depth, sun angle, cloud cover, time of year, and other factors. Moreover, the depth of the shift from photic to aphotic occurs at different points in the water column, depending on the ecosystem, watershed, and suspended substances reducing water clarity. In addition to its use as an indicator of water clarity, it also allows an assessment of whether light is penetrating to the benthic community. For example, if the euphotic depth is deeper than the water depth, sufficient light will reach the bottom to support benthic photosynthesis; if it is less than the water depth, insufficient light will penetrate to the bottom. Thus, by comparing the Z<sub>eu</sub> product to a bathymetry map in a GIS package, a determination can be made as to whether enough light is reaching the bottom for seagrass primary production, and how the production might vary spatially and seasonally (of course, the production also depends on nutrients, etc.).

        For this project, the data were classified according to the CMECS turbidity modifier. Turbidity is a factor of the suspended solids and color within the water column, and it affects light attenuation and the depth to which light penetrates in the water column. This is critically important for autotrophs that convert light to photosynthetic products. Turbidity also has important effects on visual hunting and predation avoidance. While turbidity is frequently reported in Nephelometric Turbidity Units (NTUs), CMECS establishes categories for turbidity based on Secchi disk depth; it would be difficult to standardize turbidity by NTUs due to regional variations in background measurements. Secchi disk observations are commonly used in the marine environment. However, for this study, light penetration was determined by euphotic depth, as described above. While there is currently no algorithm for the northern Gulf of Mexico to convert euphotic depth to the equivalency of Secchi depth readings, such conversions have been successfully performed in other coastal waters. For the purposes of this exercise, euphotic depths were assigned the same terminology used for the CMECS turbidity modifier.
