Only about 5-10% of the coral observed was living. Cup corals were abundant on the dead L. pertusa, while sponges and soft corals were rare. The most common mobile invertebrates were Eumunida picta and brittle stars. A single Rochinia crassa was observed and collected.

In the soft substrate rubble mix Phykalleia spp. was abundant in patches. Mound substrate of rock ledge and rubble was covered with abundant mixed fauna. Hard corals were represented by individuals of Lophelia pertusa, Madrepora oculata, Enallopsammia profunda, and numerous cup corals.

The dominant deep-sea coral is Lophelia pertusa, which colonizes the rocks as well as builds bioherms. Black corals (mostly Leiopathes sp.) are common on the rocky hardgrounds, reach large sizes, and can be hundreds to thousands of years old. Other cniderians observed in this area include Madrepora oculata, Enallopsammia profunda, Plumarella sp., Bathypathes sp., Stylaster spp., Keratoisis sp., cup corals, and numerous anemones.
