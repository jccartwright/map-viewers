Beginning with the European colonization nearly four hundred years ago, much of New England's maritime traffic has moved through the sanctuary. This high density of vessels combined with stormy weather and human error has resulted in the loss of hundreds of vessels. Locating these shipwrecks is challenging; sanctuary depths range from 25 to 180 meters (m) and the offshore waters provide few geographic references for location. Furthermore, many vessels simply disappeared without a trace. Lacking clearly defined vessel losses, this project sought to map the seafloor on the approaches to the historic ports of Gloucester, Salem, Marblehead, and Boston. Sanctuary archaeologists believed that high resolution systematic survey of a large area along the shipping routes used by Massachusetts' oldest ports was the best way to locate historic shipwrecks and possibly a shipwreck from the earliest periods of United States history.","arch, mapping, subs",mpa,"srvx, prosas",,coldnwatl,http://oceanexplorer.noaa.gov/explorations/10sbnms/welcome.html,stellwagen_2010.jpg,,,"Collection of Documents, Images, and Video Highlights; Get Data; NOAA Central Library Cruise Catalog; http://www.lib.noaa.gov/uhtbin/cgisirsi/x/x/0/5/?searchdata1=ocn708579393",,,,,,,,,,,http://service.ncddc.noaa.gov/rdn/oer-waf/ISO/Resolved/2010/StellwagenBank2010_COLLECTION_LIBRARY_HOLDINGS_RESOLVED.html

The primary focus for the Office of Ocean Exploration and Research (OER) during EX-12-05 Leg 1 is to test the use of an AUV operated from the Okeanos Explorer while the ship is outfitted for ""full"" exploration mode and to explore what it will take to integrate an AUV into telepresence-enabled exploration. NSF and WHOI objectives for this cruise include a series of engineering trials and experiments of the Sentry AUV capabilities. NSF objectives for this cruise also include survey data collection using the Sentry AUV and Okeanos Explorer systems that will support a follow-on NSF-funded project at Blake Ridge in 2013 with Principal Investigator, Cindy Van Dover.","mapping, tele, newtech, seep",,okeanos,"Okeanos Mapping Cruises, Atlantic Methane Seeps","coldwatl, warmnwatl",http://oceanexplorer.noaa.gov/okeanos/welcome.html,ex1101.jpg,,Cruise Ship Track (kml); Open; Thinned Ship Track in KML format; http://oer.hpc.msstate.edu/okeanos/ex1205l1/ex1205l1-ShipTrack.kml | Seafloor Mapping Products Collection; Download; Collection of low-res Bathymetric Images for Cruise; http://oer.hpc.msstate.edu/okeanos/ex1205l1/ex1205l1-mappingsurvey.zip | Mapping Data Report; Open; Mapping Data Report; http://oer.hpc.msstate.edu/okeanos/ex1205l1/ex1205l1-mapping-data-report.pdf | CTD Summary Reports and Profile Data; Download; Zip File of All Water Column Profile Data; http://oer.hpc.msstate.edu/okeanos/media/ex1205l1/ex1205l1-profile-data.zip,"Multibeam Archive Collection; Get Data; National Geophysical Data Center Archive Collection; http://www.ngdc.noaa.gov/nndc/struts/results?op_0=eq&t=101378&s=8&d=70&d=75&d=76&d=74&d=73&d=72&d=81&d=82&d=85&d=86&d=79&no_data=suppress&v_0=NEW1857 | Trackline Data (Single-beam and Sub-bottom); Get Data; National Geophysical Data Center; http://www.ngdc.noaa.gov/trackline/request/?surveyIds=EX1205_1 | Physical, Chemical, and Biological Archive Collection; Get Data; National Oceanographic Data Center Archive Collection; http://accession.nodc.noaa.gov/93861 | Collection of Documents, Images, and Video Highlights; Get Data; NOAA Central Library Cruise Catalog; http://www.lib.noaa.gov/uhtbin/cgisirsi/x/x/0/5/?searchdata1=%20ocn911060624",Ship Navigation Data (ASCII); Download; ASCII Data from Ship Navigation Instruments; http://oer.hpc.msstate.edu/okeanos/ex1205l1/ex1205l1-Ship-Nav-Data.zip | Ship SCS/Sensor Data (ASCII); Download; ASCII Data from Ship Meteorological and Oceanographic Sensors; http://oer.hpc.msstate.edu/okeanos/ex1205l1/ex1205l1-SCS-Data.zip | Ship SCS/Sensor Data (NetCDF); Open; NetCDF file from Ship Meteorological and Oceanographic Sensors; http://ecowatch.ncddc.noaa.gov/thredds/catalog/ocean_exploration_research/catalog.html?dataset=ocean_exploration_research/EX1205L1_SCS.nc,http://service.ncddc.noaa.gov/website/EXAtlas/viewer.htm#,EX1205L1,EX1205L1,Bathymetry Mosaic;OE_Bathymetry_Products;108;bathy.jpg|Ship Track;OE_OkeanosShipTrk;74;2012ST.jpg|Dive Locations;OE_OkeanosDives;18;2012D.jpg|Dive Tracks;OE_OkeanosDives;19;2012DTL.jpg|Non-Dive Locations;OE_OkeanosCTDs;19;2012ND.jpg,,,http://oceanexplorer.noaa.gov/okeanos/edu/welcome.html,,,http://service.ncddc.noaa.gov/rdn/oer-waf/ISO/Resolved/2012/EX1205L1_COLLECTION_RESOLVED.html

These survivor camps represent the physical remains of France’s attempt to colonize this area of the New World in opposition to Spain’s competing interests. The subsequent massacre of French survivors by the Spanish spelled the end of France’s nationalistic ambitions in this region.

Opportunistic CTD rosette operations may be requested to collect more information about the environmental parameters at ROV dives sites, or opportunistically at selected sites where collecting the data is considered important to understanding the physical or chemical properties of the overlying water column.","mapping, tele",,okeanos,Okeanos ROV Cruises,,http://oceanexplorer.noaa.gov/okeanos/explorations/ex1605/welcome.html,okeanos.jpg,,"Cruise Ship Track (kml); Open; Thinned Ship Track in KML format; http://oer.hpc.msstate.edu/okeanos/ex1605l1/EX1605l1_CNAV-GGA_shiptrack_rdp_thinned.kml | Seafloor Mapping Products Collection; Download; Collection of low-res Bathymetric Images for Cruise; http://oer.hpc.msstate.edu/okeanos/ex1605l1/ex1605l1-mappingsurvey.zip |  Mapping Data Report; Open; Mapping Data Report; http://oer.hpc.msstate.edu/okeanos/ex1605l1/ex1605l1-mapping-data-report.pdf | CTD Summary Reports and Profile Data; Download; Zip File of All Water Column Profile Data; http://oer.hpc.msstate.edu/okeanos/ex1605l1/ex1605l1-profile-data.zip | ROV Dive Summary Reports and Data; Open; Access Dive Reports, Videos, Images, Clips, and Ancillary Data; http://service.ncddc.noaa.gov/rdn/oer-rov-cruises/ex1605l1","Trackline Data (Single-beam and Sub-bottom); Get Data; National Geophysical Data Center; http://www.ngdc.noaa.gov/trackline/request/?surveyIds=EX1605_1 | Physical, Chemical, and Biological Archive Collection; Get Data; National Oceanographic Data Center Archive Collection; http://accession.nodc.noaa.gov/0155916",Ship Navigation Data (ASCII); Download; ASCII Data from Ship Navigation Instruments; http://oer.hpc.msstate.edu/okeanos/ex1605l1/ex1605l1-Ship-Nav-Data.zip | Ship SCS/Sensor Data (ASCII); Download; ASCII Data from Ship Meteorological and Oceanographic Sensors; http://oer.hpc.msstate.edu/okeanos/ex1605l1/ex1605l1-SCS-Data.zip |  Submersible Navigation/Sensor Data (ASCII); Download; ASCII Data from Submersible Meteorological and Oceanographic Sensors; http://oer.hpc.msstate.edu/okeanos/ex1605l1/ex1605l1-Sub-Data.zip | Ship SCS/Sensor Data (NetCDF); Open; NetCDF file from Ship Meteorological and Oceanographic Sensors; http://ecowatch.ncddc.noaa.gov/thredds/catalog/ocean_exploration_research/catalog.html?dataset=ocean_exploration_research/EX1605l1_SCS.nc,http://service.ncddc.noaa.gov/website/EXAtlas/viewer.htm#,EX1605L1,EX1605L1,,http://oceanexplorer.noaa.gov/okeanos/explorations/ex1605/background/edu/edu.html,,http://oceanexplorer.noaa.gov/okeanos/edu/welcome.html,,,

operations. Multibeam and singlebeam mapping operations will be conducted 24 hours a day throughout the
cruise. Sub-bottom profile mapping will be conducted 24 hours a day at the discretion of the CO. XBT and/or
